  "articleText": "HOME DESIGN & DECORATING DECORATING DESIGN TIPS\nIKEA Curtain Hack: How to Make IKEA Curtains Look Expensive\nBy NOMITA VAISH-TAYLOR\nPublished on 07/19/23\nsergoua / Getty Images\nCurtains are one of those design elements that can really elevate a room. If you’ve ever shopped for curtains though, you’ll know that they can often be expensive, especially if they’re custom drapes. Multiply that by all the windows in a home and it quickly adds up to even bigger numbers. But being budget conscious doesn’t mean you have to compromise on style and with this simple IKEA curtain hack, you don’t have to.\nWith the help of some pleating hooks, you can easily add pinch pleats to IKEA curtains for a tailored look. This curtain hack works with any IKEA curtain that comes with pleating tape attached on to the back. Nearly all of IKEA's curtains have this so there's plenty to choose from. And there's no sewing involved either so you don't need any needle and thread skills.\nHere's how to hack your IKEA curtains to take them from ho-hum to high-end.\nIulian Catalin / 500px / Getty Images\nWhat You'll Need\nAny IKEA curtain with pleating tape\nFour-pronged pleat hooks\nCurtain rod\nCurtain rings with eyelets\nTip\nBefore you start, it's worth taking a few minutes to gently separate the prongs on each of your pleating hooks. This will make it much easier to insert them into the tiny pockets on the pleating tape.\nHow to Pinch Pleat IKEA Curtains for a Tailored Look\nInsert the First Pleating Hook\nWork in sections for this step, where each section is the space between the stringy tabs on the pleating tape. For now, ignore the smaller first and last sections at each end of the curtain and start at the second one.\nTake your first pleating hook and insert the first prong in to the fourth pocket from the start of the section. Leave the next two pockets empty and insert the second prong in to the third pocket (which would be the seventh pocket from the start of the section).\nOnce again, leave the next two pockets empty and insert the third prong in to the third pocket. Continue the same spacing with the fourth prong. You'll now have three pockets left in this section, which will be left empty.\nYou’ll see that the pleating tape has three rows of pockets. For each pleating hook, it’s easier to insert all four prongs in to the first row of pockets, then all four into the middle pocket and finally all four into the top pocket. This part can be quite fiddly, so inserting them in this way makes it a little easier to get them into the tiny pockets.\nContinue Inserting the Pleating Hooks\nAfter you’ve got your first pleating hook in, repeat the same pattern in the next section. Continue doing this until you have a pleating hook in each section of the curtain.\nTip\nAs you insert each pleating hook, flip over the curtain to check each pleat. If something doesn't look quite right, check your prong spacing. Doing this as you work will avoid you having to redo anything later.\nInsert Hooks in the End Sections\nInsert one pleating hook in both the smaller end sections of the curtain. There’s no need for pleating here, so you don’t have to leave any pockets empty. Simply insert the four prongs into the first four pockets at each end. This will hold the curtain ends up, preventing the edges from drooping.\nHang Up Your Curtains\nThe last step is to hang your curtains up. It’s easiest to hang your curtains once you’ve put your rod up and threaded it with the curtain rings. Then, all you need to do is slip each pleat hook into each eyelet of the curtain ring.\nTips for Making IKEA Curtains Look High-End\nChoose curtain rings that are just one size larger than your rod which will give a more polished look (e.g., use a 1-inch curtain rod with 1 1/2-inch curtain rings).\nUse a curtain rod that is wider than your window so that, when open, the curtains just brush the edge of the window frame. You can even go wider which will give the illusion of larger windows.\nPlace your curtain rod as high as you can. This simple trick makes your ceilings appear higher and makes the curtains look more custom made.\nFor an even more polished finished, add a stitch at the base of each pleat so that the pleats are more defined. This accentuates the tailored look.\n52 Living Room Curtain Ideas to Put a Finishing Touch on Any Space"

  "articleText": "If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation.\nHOME NEWS HOME TRENDS\n18 IKEA Greenhouse Cabinet Hacks You Should Know\nWith a bit of creativity, tropical plants will fit right in\nBy MELISSA EPIFANO\nUpdated on 11/08/24\nThe Spruce / Missy Schrott\nAn IKEA greenhouse cabinet is the perfect hack to give your plants a home that's both stylish and built to help them thrive.\nThese indoor plant stations are made by repurposing various IKEA shelving units, like the DETOLF, FABRIKÖR, RUDSTA, and MILSBO. They are rearranged with grow lights, extra shelves, and areas for propagation.\nRobin Schouten, the founder of @ikeagreenhousecabinet, curates DIYed cabinets from all over the world on her account. A plant collector herself, Schouten founded the page after falling \"in love with the idea and aesthetics\" while searching for her own plant storage/display solutions.\n\"IKEA greenhouse cabinets are very versatile and can be as cheap and simple, or expensive and complex as you want,\" Schouten says. \"This all depends on your budget, DIY skills, commitment, and which kinds of plants are being kept inside of them.”\nMEET THE EXPERT\nRobin Schouten launched the Instagram account @ikeagreenhousecabinet in April after starting the hashtag #ikeagreenhousecabinet in 2019. She has amassed over 190K followers and shows inspiring examples of creative IKEA greenhouse cabinets and how-to information.\nIntrigued or inspired to make your own IKEA greenhouse cabinet? Take a look at the clever ideas below to recreate for your own plant collection.\n01\nof 18\nFit IKEA Greenhouses Into a Room\n@robinschoutenart / Instagram\nIKEA Cabinets: FABRIKÖR and MILSBO\nSchouten's arrangement in a low-light area of her home is styled just perfectly with a statement floor, bookshelves, and matching colors that let the plants shine. She added two mini fans and grow lights to her greenhouses.\nThe average humidity inside both cabinets is 80% without the use of a humidifier, which Schouten only turns on when the levels drop below 70%, and with most parts of the doors being sealed with weatherstrips.\nContinue to 2 of 18 below\n02\nof 18\nOpt for a Light, Bright Greenhouse\nErin Bishop\nIKEA Cabinets: MILSBO\nErin Bishop's bright Vancouver apartment and her equally beautiful plant cabinet are an ideal combo for those with tropical plants. To cater to some of her plants, she chose to hack an IKEA cabinet to marry the needs of her plants with the aesthetic preferences of her home.\nShe did so through wire shelves, three panels of grow lights, weather stripping, a small fan, a water tray, and a hygrometer to cover all her bases.\n\"The MILSBO allows me to see and enjoy my plants and it looks great in the apartment and works with the feel of the rest of the decor,” Bishop says.\nContinue to 3 of 18 below\n03\nof 18\nBuild a DIY Terrarium\n@Camiplants\nIKEA Cabinet: FABRIKÖR\nCami from @Camiplants got extremely creative and converted a FABRIKÖR into a huge terrarium.\n“I had to seal it and waterproof it so it wouldn’t leak everywhere when I watered the plants,\" she says. \"I also installed a fiberglass wall at the bottom so I would be allowed to open it and close it.\"\nAnother smart modification she made was cutting out a piece at the top so the light could shine in. Brilliant!\nContinue to 4 of 18 below\n04\nof 18\nGo for a Trio of Cabinets\n@vinny.aroids / Instagram\nIKEA Cabinets: One FABRIKÖR and two MILSBOs\nVinny of @Vinny.aroids loves how the IKEA Greenhouse community took over and offers major kudos to Schouten for building \"this community out of thin air.”\nHis greenhouse is home to tropical Aroid plants, and he prioritizes putting velvety plants inside, mostly anthuriums and some philodendrons.\n\"The greenhouse is great at simulating the environment in which some of these plants grow,\" he says, happy to be providing them with a stable home.\nTip\nChoose similar plants or plants with the same care requirements to go inside your greenhouse. That way you can modify it in one particular way and won't have to suit a wide range of needs—which isn't possible in this small space.\nContinue to 5 of 18 below\n05\nof 18\nBuild a Living Cabinet\n@room_kew / Instagram\nIKEA cabinet: FABRIKÖR\nFashion designer Francesco of @room_kew and @archilista built upon a cobalt blue FABRIKÖR unit to create this stunning corner full of plant life, including a living cabinet.\nRather than installing shelves in this IKEA hack, he followed a similar route to the terrarium above, using expanding foam and moss for his base. A grow light and weather strip keep the conditions perfect in the mini biome.\nContinue to 6 of 18 below\n06\nof 18\nDesignate a Greenhouse Room\n@viitheplantdad / Instagram\nIKEA cabinet: RUDSTA\nAnyone ready to dedicate a full room to their plant endeavors can copy @viitheplantdad's set-up. He added lights, a thermometer, and fans to his IKEA greenhouse. For extra storage in this fantastic room-turned-plant-workshop, he tapped two IVAR cabinets from IKEA to place on either side.\nContinue to 7 of 18 below\n07\nof 18\nDouble Up on IKEA Greenhouses\n@nicolelarsongrows / Instagram\nIKEA cabinet: One MILSBO and one FABRIKÖR\nThis combination of two IKEA cabinets to creat a plant room is from the brilliant mind of @nicolelarsongrows. Grow lights were added to both spaces to encourage plants to sprout, lengthen, and fill out. Having two areas of sufficient light is doubly efficient for serious plant enthusiasts.\nContinue to 8 of 18 below\n08\nof 18\nUse Pegboard Backing\n@rexiemxoxo / Instagram\nIKEA cabinet: MILSBO\nAn IKEA cabinet will need some tweaks to make it fully functional as a greenhouse, but @rexiemxoxo took this hack a step further by enhancing the storage space, too.\nAside from installing grow lights, Rexie added pegboard backing to make space for additional hangable shelves. All the plants in orange and white pots make for a stylish aesthetic, too.\nContinue to 9 of 18 below\n09\nof 18\nTurn a Cart Into a Greenhouse\n@the_jungle_in_my_house / Instagram\nIKEA cabinet: ÅKERBÄR greenhouse\nThis is a slightly different take on an IKEA greenhouse from @the_jungle_in_my_house. Rather than a cabinet, San used a glass greenhouse from IKEA and placed that atop a matching rolling cart.\nAlthough it hasn't been sealed, it holds a small amount of humidity and is a great holding place for plants waiting to be propagated, watered, fed, or placed in a new area.\nContinue to 10 of 18 below\n10\nof 18\nGo for a Glass Aesthetic\n@loveforplants__ / Instagram\nIKEA cabinet: DETOLF\nWith glass surfaces on nearly all sides, a DETOLF cabinet from IKEA makes a great candidate for a plant greenhouse hack or display case. @loveforplants__ added grow lights inside the tops and adjusted the shelves to create adequate room for taller and shorter plants.\nContinue to 11 of 18 below\n11\nof 18\nMake a Station for Grow Lights\n@the.plant.gal / Instagram\nIKEA cabinet: MILSBO (100-cm tall version)\nA greenhouse cabinet can help out if you live in an area that doesn't get much sun or in a home that doesn't get a lot of natural light.\nTake a page out of the @the.plant.gal's book. She included a standard grow light and a purple-toned one for extra support sitting atop the unit.\nWhile most need to be watered, plants with self-watering planters are occasionally added to the cabinet. Sshe added monstera leaf handles to make it feel special.\nTip\nAdd a grow light to an IKEA cabinet using metal clips or magnetic strips. Depending on how involved you want the project to be, you can also drill holes to run cords through the back of your cabinet for a tidy look.\nContinue to 12 of 18 below\n12\nof 18\nCreate a Mega Shelving Unit\n@msplantastic / Instagram\nIKEA cabinet: MILSBO (100-cm tall version)\nDon't contain your passion and plants in one small greenhouse, extend your plant's platform onwards and upwards—literally. As @msplantastic did here, add wire shelves and a grow light within, but also place other lights and a humidifier outside the greenhouse on higher shelves or the floor.\nContinue to 13 of 18 below\n13\nof 18\nCreate a Full Vignette\n@mrs.plantmama / Instagram\nIKEA cabinet: MILSBO (100-cm tall version)\nYour plant area doesn't have to stick out like a sore thumb. It can blend seamlessly with the rest of your home decor, as @mrs.plantmama proves.\nFor plant care, she added grow lights, a hygrometer, and a pegboard for hanging more plants. In terms of style, Woven baskets, a wooden textured humidifier, an earthy lamp, and a variety of cool glass vessels and planters make this corner stand out.\nContinue to 14 of 18 below\n14\nof 18\nUse a Cabinet as a Display Case\n@thriftygrrl / Instagram\nIKEA cabinet: FABRIKÖR\nKristine S. of @thriftygrrl chose a sage green, narrower version of the FABRIKÖR for her IKEA greenhouse hack. Rather than outfitting it with tons of wires, lights, and self-watering trays, she took a simpler route.\nThis is a great choice for anyone who isn't interested in major modifications and spotlights potted plants on wooden mats. This works as a lovely way to rotate through different plants and admire a new collection every few weeks.\nContinue to 15 of 18 below\n15\nof 18\nBuild In Multiple Sun Exposures\n@plantekamilla / Instagram\nIKEA cabinet: From IKEA Norway, the most similar would be BLÅLIDEN or DETOLF\nUnless you have all the same plants or a collection with very similar needs, you might need several options for lighting, something an IKEA greenhouse can help with.\nThis lovely double cabinet set-up from @plantekamilla offers controlled lighting with the help of grow bulbs and it's also near a window for a few different sunlight options.\nContinue to 16 of 18 below\n16\nof 18\nProvide an Area for Potted Plants\n@stek_roomtogrow / Instagram\nIKEA cabinet: MILSBO (100-cm tall version)\nPlants recently transplanted, propagated, or repotted can have a stable and safe environment to adjust in a greenhouse cabinet, just like this one from @stek_roomtogrow. Use glass shelves, trays, and raised surfaces to keep them organized.\nContinue to 17 of 18 below\n17\nof 18\nAdd Contrast to a Plant Room\n@therooted.home / andie.frykowski / Instagram\nIKEA cabinet: RUDSTA\nKeep on theme with a bold black IKEA cabinet. This is especially perfect for plants with darker-toned leaves (like alocasia and anthurium) if you're trying to solidify a chic and sleek result.\nHere, Andie Frykowski from @therooted.home used three RUDSTAs and added a fan, humidifier, and grow lights to make it suitable for plants.\nContinue to 18 of 18 below\n18\nof 18\nConstruct a Mini Ecosystem\n@theberryjungle / Instagram\nIKEA cabinet: MILSBO\nUse your DIY greenhouse as the starting and focal point of your plant area, but continue building around it, as @theberryjungle did here. She added grow lights, wire shelves, and a fan for a clever IKEA cabinet hack. Outside, she set up multi-tiered holders and shelves for trailing and climbing plants.\nFAQ\nWhich IKEA cabinets are used to make greenhouses?\nThere is no right or wrong answer, but the most popular IKEA cabinets used for greenhouses are FABRIKÖR, MILSBO, RUDSTA, BAGGEBO, and DELTOF models.\nDo IKEA greenhouses work?\nYes! With the right modifications and great prep for the perfect plant environment, IKEA greenhouses can be wonderful spaces to house your plants while keeping them healthy.\nCan you use a curio cabinet as a greenhouse?\nYes, but you'll need to modify it. Standard curio cabinets won't come with grow lights, fans, humidifiers, and other plant-growing accessories. If the curio cabinet is wood and you intend to have a humid greenhouse, it's better to paint and seal it properly so the cabinet doesn't get moldy (or find a metal version).\nAre IKEA greenhouse cabinets more affordable?\nIKEA greenhouse cabinets can be more affordable than specialty cabinets, particularly if you use your DIY skills to make a basic one to fit your needs. You can add lights, ventilation, and other requirements to help your plants thrive, without paying a premium for a specialty greenhouse cabinet."

  "articleText": "HOME DESIGN & DECORATING DECORATING FURNITURE\nWhat You Need to Know About IKEA Furniture\nBy ABE ABBAS\nUpdated on 04/22/24\nAndreas Rentz / Getty Images\nIN THIS ARTICLE\nPros\nFavorite Pieces\nCons\nHow to Shop\nAbout IKEA\nBACK TO TOP\nIKEA is one of the best-recognized furniture brands all over the world. It appeals to a young and hip audience, as it makes affordable furniture and home furnishing choices that are especially favored by those just starting out on their own.\nIf you're looking for high quality, heirloom furniture, you will need to consider other brands as you shop around, but IKEA furniture is certainly affordable, attractive, and provides the opportunity to be creative.\nPlus, IKEA increasingly offers higher-end furniture to appeal to shoppers of all income levels and tastes. You can buy unfinished furniture, or even mix and match parts to create your own customized furniture. The brand is so popular that an entire industry has developed around DIYs and hacks of IKEA products in an effort to help you customize your furniture even more.\nThe Pros for Buying IKEA Furniture\nAffordable and Attractive\nThere is something to be said about affordable furniture that is also attractive. It is possible to furnish an entire home from top to bottom for a comparatively modest amount, making IKEA furniture ideal for those on a budget or those who are just starting out.\nThat is not to say that their furniture does not have other, more luxurious uses, though: Even well-known designers such as Lori Dennis throw an IKEA piece in the mix when designing an interior.\nLots of Accessories\nLighting, rugs, bedding, textiles, and accessories are available to complement any furniture purchase, and there are also plenty of efficient storage solutions for the entire home. IKEA offers signature lines of furniture, making it easy to choose accessories that match.\nGreat for Small Spaces\nIKEA has much to offer for small spaces. This is ideal for those of us living in smaller homes or studio apartments. IKEA even offers online guides for small rooms, laying out the specifics of what minimal furniture you need for a functioning living room, bedroom, etc.\nEasy to Assemble and Transport\nThe furniture is relatively easy to assemble, and you can even find pieces that don't require tools for assembly. Efficient packaging makes it easy to transport.\nSustainability Efforts\nIKEA is also paying more attention to sustainability and making their products greener. For instance, the brand has banned PVC from its products, and reduced formaldehyde from lacquers and glues. The company is also using and looking to increase the use of new and sustainable materials. \nFavorite IKEA Pieces\nThere is always something new, but some affordable favorites have endured over the years:\nThe Poang armchair has a layered and glued bentwood frame of birch. The chairs have enough give to make them comfortable. The cushions are available in fabric or leather.\nThe Lack series, with side tables and coffee tables which come in many different finishes, have also been popular through the years.\nBilly bookcases, which come in many sizes and finishes.\nIKEA Poang Rocker IKEA\nWhat's Not to Love About IKEA Furniture\nWhen you shop at IKEA, you should not expect to find heirloom quality furniture. While most of the products are certainly affordable, longevity is not typically a common attribute. (Very often affordability and quality do not go hand in hand unless you are buying used furniture.) Certainly, IKEA is not the only brand that sells affordable but lesser-quality furniture.\nLargely made from particleboard, IKEA furniture most often does not stand up to years of use. Disassembling and transporting the furniture during a move can also shorten its lifespan. And while IKEA has done much to address environmental concerns regarding its furniture materials, to call it entirely green is a stretch simply because it lacks one very important feature of green furniture—durability. That is especially true of the more affordable furniture at IKEA.\nHow To Shop for Furniture At IKEA\nA single IKEA store carries everything you need to furnish a home: from furniture to kitchen cabinets, to lighting, down to brushes for washing dishes. Since IKEA stores strive to present the same shopping experience at all their locations, you can maintain a single strategy for shopping at any IKEA. \nYou can find a lot of information about their products, including dimensions, colors, prices, and availability at your local store or online. This allows you to decide beforehand what you will be buying once you get there. If you show up without making plans, you can spend an eternity in their labyrinthine showrooms.\nYou can purchase the furniture and take it home with you right away. If you prefer, it can also be delivered, but make sure to check out delivery charges. (For large deliveries, IKEA charges a flat-rate fee.) To find an IKEA store close to you, visit the IKEA Store Locator. If there is no IKEA store in your vicinity, you can shop online.\nAbout IKEA\nFor all its youthful appearance, IKEA is not a newcomer to the industry. The company started out in 1943 in a small village called Agunnaryd in Sweden. IKEA's founder Ingvar Kamprad was only 17 at the time.\nToday, the company has grown into a major international furniture and home furnishings brand operating across the world. There are more than 400 stores in countries around the world that stock home furnishings and furniture for the entire home under one roof, all easily recognizable by their blue and yellow logo."

  "articleText": "HOME DESIGN & DECORATING DECORATING\nYour Complete Guide to Shopping at IKEA\nBy TONYA LEE\nUpdated on 02/22/24\nHector Vivas / Getty Images\nIN THIS ARTICLE\nBefore You Arrive\nWhen You Arrive\nKnow the Floorplan\nHow to Use the Product Tag\nDining and Bringing Children\nAdditional Tips\nBACK TO TOP\nIkea stores worldwide are known (and loved) for their inventories of dynamic, hackable, affordable home decor, furnishings, and plant collections. While Ikea hacks are much-loved methods for upgrading or customizing Ikea's standard offerings, Ikea's always-shifting variety of products at different price points and in different styles has something for everyone.\nFortunately, there is a method for understanding how Ikea operates, and here are some tips to ease you along in your Ikea shopping experience.\nBefore You Arrive\nWhile the hype around Ikea is well-earned, a first-time visitor to an Ikea store may feel a little overwhelmed by the large stores, multiple floors, cafeteria, and organizational system.\nBefore heading out, make sure you measure your car. You don't want to end up purchasing something that won't fit in your vehicle. It helps to browse Ikea's website before you arrive, so you have an idea of the areas you want to visit or the items you want to see in their showrooms. Ikea's online catalog does a good job of listing all the product dimensions. But it also helps to take measurements of your space at home, especially if you're thinking about a particular piece of furniture. It saves you from having to make a return trip.\nQuick Tip\nWeekdays generally tend to be a quieter time to visit IKEA than weekends. July and August also tend to be the busiest times of year.\nWhen You Arrive\nWhen you come through the door, you can pick up a few things to aid you in your shopping experience.\nA map: It’s easy to get trapped in Ikea’s maze of departments and aisles.\nDownload the app: This can help make your shopping experience much easier and less overwhelming.\nAn Ikea notepad and pencil: You might want to write down the location numbers and order numbers of items you wish to purchase. If you prefer, you can also use a mobile phone to take a snapshot of the item tag, which will help you place your order or know where to find it in the self-serve warehouse.\nAn Ikea shopping bag, cart, or both\nTape measures are provided, so you won’t need to bring yours.\nKnow the Floorplan\nIkea is separated into four areas: the showroom, marketplace, self-serve warehouse, and checkout. Interspersed in that layout are bathrooms, the cafeteria, and the indoor playground for children.\nShowroom: Usually located on the top level, the showroom is your own private, grown-up playhouse. Ikea assembles home displays into galleries that look as if you walked into a room of a home. If you're browsing and don't know precisely what you are shopping for, you'll spend a lot of time in the showroom. You can see, touch, take photos, and measure assembled Ikea furniture. The tag on the item will tell you where to find it and how much it costs. Record this info on your notepad (or take a photo of the tag) to make gathering items at the end of your shopping trip easier.\nMarketplace: If you want to pick up Ikea decor accessories or kitchen goods, you'll find them in the market, including vases, pillows, curtains, fabric, picture frames, artwork, lighting, dishes, kitchen utensils, rugs, and more.\nSelf-serve warehouse: The warehouse is where you will find the furniture you viewed in the showroom; you only need to load it onto a flatbed cart and bring it to checkout. Use the product tag information to find the correct aisle where the product is located. Nearly all large items will be flat-packed in boxes for you to load the cart relatively easily.\nCheckout: Pay for your items at checkout. If the item you are buying is oversized or has multiple pieces, it may not be in the self-serve warehouse, and you will need to get it at the furniture pickup area near the store exit after you have paid for it at checkout.\nHow to Use the Product Tag and Get Help\nExamine the product tag carefully. It lists colors, materials, sizes, cost, and other useful information, but also the shelf number where you can collect the item from the warehouse or how to place the order to collect it at the furniture pick-up area.\nIf you need help, salespeople can often be found across the various rooms. They can usually be found at the blue and yellow information booths scattered throughout the showroom and at the desk in the warehouse's center aisle.\nMany Ikea stores offer a consultant service if you wish to furnish an entire room or home. For assistance with kitchen, office, or bedroom planning, the Ikea website offers several planning tools.\nDining There and Bringing Children\nIf you're getting hungry, most Ikeas have two dining areas. The main self-serve cafeteria-style restaurant serves prepared foods, featuring its famous Swedish meatballs, at discounted prices. The bistro cafe has grab-and-go options, like hot dogs, usually located by the checkout area. An added perk is children can sometimes eat free (or heavily discounted) at Ikea with an adult meal purchase.\nKids play for free in the Smaland playground. It is an adult-supervised play area for potty-trained children 37 inches to 54 inches. The max time is 1 hour. The same person who dropped them off will have to pick them up. However, most children often enjoy going through Ikea, too. You'll often find toddlers to teens frolicking throughout the store.\nTip\nIf you live too far from the closest store, Ikea offers online shopping and flat-rate shipping on many of its items.\nAdditional Tips\nSign up as a member of the Ikea family program to score discounts and more.\nBring your bags to checkout unless you don't mind paying the small charge for Ikea's bags.\nDon't bypass the \"as-is\" section, usually located by the checkout area. Great deals can be had here, especially if you don't mind doing a little TLC.\nKitchen cabinetry is not available for pick-up in the self-serve warehouse. To purchase kitchen cabinetry, Ikea requires that you plan out your space first. You may design it at home online and print out your supply list or use the computers in your store's kitchen section, where Ikea provides a kitchen planner to help. After purchase, proceed to Ikea's furniture pick-up area to receive your cabinets and installation hardware."

  "articleText": "HOME NEWS BRANDS & COLLECTIONS\nI've Tried Dozens of IKEA Hacks—5 of My Must-Have Buys and How to Hack Them\nBy NOMITA VAISH-TAYLOR\nPublished on 05/21/24\nClaire Douglas Styling\nI’ll be the first to admit that I cannot resist an IKEA hack. My own home is full of them because where else can you get affordable pieces that offer a chameleon-like quality for transformation?\nIKEA pieces are great as they are but what makes them extra special is that they also allow you to create something unique for your home. Best of all, there is no one way to hack any IKEA piece—the same piece can be given so many different looks.\nAs a serial hacker, I’ve learned that some pieces are better for hacking than others. These pieces tend to be completely blank canvases that are affordable too.\nMy Favorite IKEA Ranges to Hack\nIKEA Sektion: Sometimes called Metod in some countries, IKEA's most basic and affordable kitchen cabinets fall under the radar of many but they offer so much potential beyond the kitchen.\nIKEA Ivar: Their simple profile and untreated wood finish makes Ivar pieces ripe for transformation.\nIKEA Blanda: A range of basic serving bowls that can be turned into so many unexpected items, with a little imagination\nIKEA Kallax: The popular Kallax cubes are handy shelves but they can also be transformed beyond recognition into different pieces of furniture.\nIKEA Billy: The Billy bookcase is no stranger to being hacked but the hacks below are the best I've seen so prepare to be wowed!\nIf you’re looking for some inspiration for your next hack (or your first), I’ve picked out some ideas on how you can transform them. I've included more than one hack per piece to show just how versatile each of these pieces are.\n01\nof 12\nSektion Living Room Storage Hack\nYour DIY Family\nFirst up is one of my very own hacks which you can see more of on Your DIY Family. Finding a long and low profile storage unit for my living room was almost impossible and the few I did find were way over budget. So I decided to hack the Sektion cabinets.\nI used the narrowest Sektion base cabinets which I turned on their side. I trimmed each cabinet as they were a bit too deep for my space and then bolted them to each other to prevent them moving around. Finally I topped the cabinets with a couple of MDF sheets covered in marble contact paper.\nContinue to 2 of 12 below\n02\nof 12\nSektion Wall To Wall Cabinet Hack\nMaiju Saw\nBuilt in storage that goes wall to wall usually requires custom carpentry which can be very pricey. Instead Maiju from Maiju Saw found the perfect solution by hacking the Sektion cabinets.\nShe lined up the cabinets in her space and added some plinths for a built-in look. She opted for the most basic cabinet doors which she enhanced by adding trim to them. Being kitchen base cabinets, they didn't have tops so she got some MDF sheets for the top and painted everything in a soft grey.\nContinue to 3 of 12 below\n03\nof 12\nPainted Ivar Cabinet Hack\n@alloverthehouse / Instagram\nI've come across many painted Ivar cabinets but this one really stood out because of the two-tone look.\nNot only did Magdalena from @alloverthehouse go for two striking colors but she also didn't attach doors to one of the cabinets. The end result is a unique cabinet offering both open and closed storage. And of course, you can opt for any color combination that works for your decor style.\nContinue to 4 of 12 below\n04\nof 12\nIvar Cabinet Desk Hack\n@octobre_et_mai / Instagram\nCecile from @octobre_et_mai transformed the Ivar cabinets into a desk with lots of useful storage.\nTo make this desk, you’ll need to line up as many Ivar cabinets as your space allows, leaving a gap to place a chair or stool. Next, get a piece of pine cut to size to make the desktop. Attach this to the top of the cabinets using screws at each end.\nWhile this desk has been left in it's natural state, you could paint the cabinets to customize the look even more.\nContinue to 5 of 12 below\n05\nof 12\nIvar Side Unit Divider Hack\nSchere leim papier\nAside from the Ivar cabinets, there's another piece in this range thats hiding in plain sight but often overlooked—the Ivar side unit. By joining three of them with door hinges, Luisa from Schere leim papier created an elegant room divider.\nShe added a chic sun inspired detail to each of the panels to complete the divider. If you need a room divider that gives more privacy, you can take this idea and attach rattan or even some opaque fabric to the panels.\nContinue to 6 of 12 below\n06\nof 12\nBlanda Vase Hack\n@once.upon.a.home / Instagram\nSimple, wooden salad bowls have been transformed in to this oversized sculptural vase.\nAdeline from @once.upon.a.home glued two different sized bowls together and sprayed the entire piece black.\nContinue to 7 of 12 below\n07\nof 12\nBlanda Coffee Table Hack\n@chloejjarri / Instagram / Photo by Carina Romano\nFrom salad bowl to designer coffee table!\nChloe from @chloejjarri made this stylish coffee table by gluing some Blanda bowls together to make large, spherical legs. She then attached a piece of pine wood to create the tabletop and painted the entire piece in a creamy beige.\nContinue to 8 of 12 below\n08\nof 12\nKallax Stool Hack\n@va_va_room / Instagram\nUsing just a single Kallax cube, Tori from @va_va_room turned it in to a stylish stool.\nOnce she had covered the open sides of the cube with some hardboard, she glued some foam to the top of the cube for the seat. She covered each cube in striped fabric and ended up with these stylish stools. The covers are removable meaning you don't have to worry about spills.\nContinue to 9 of 12 below\n09\nof 12\nKallax Sideboard Hack\nBlack with navy\nLauren from Black with navy flipped a tall Kallax shelf unit on it's side to create this stylish sideboard.\nShe added Kallax inserts with doors to each of the cubes. Wanting to elevate the look further, she glued dowels to each of the doors to create the fluted look. After painting the entire unit white, she added some mid-century inspired legs and minimalist black handles to complete the sideboard.\nContinue to 10 of 12 below\n10\nof 12\nBuilt-In Billy Bookcase Hack\nClaire Douglas Styling\nBuilt-in Billy bookcase hacks aren't new but I don't think I've ever come across one as pretty as this one by Claire from Claire Douglas Styling.\nAdding skirting board to the base and MDF to the top, Claire created the built-in look of this bookcase. But it's the additional details that really elevate this hack. She glued MDF strips to the joins between the bookcases as well as to the shelf fronts to give it a more substantial, custom-built look.\nShe also added fluting to the doors and finished the bookcase in the most gorgeous pastels by painting the wall behind in a peachy-pink and the bookcase in a blue-green hue.\nContinue to 11 of 12 below\n11\nof 12\nArched Billy Bookcase Hack\nOur Aesthetic Abode\nThis may not be the easiest Billy bookcase hack but it's definitely one of the most high-end looking one's I've seen. The arches add so much style and elegance.\nElisha from Our Aesthetic Abode first created a platform to place the bookcases on so that they were slightly elevated off the floor. She then made up the bookcases and secured them to the wall. Using plywood sheets, she cut arches and framed the bookcases with these. Finally she painted the bookcases in a dark grey color.\nContinue to 12 of 12 below\n12\nof 12\nDisplay Cabinet Billy Bookcase Hack\nPeony and Honey\nErica from Peony and Honey turned her Billy bookcase into a designer inspired display cabinet.\nStarting with the Billy bookcase with glass doors, she glued fluted trim to the bottom half of the glass doors. She then cut some hardboard to create the arches and glued this to the top half of the cabinet. She used chalk paint in a pale peach color for a pretty, matte finish."

  "articleText": "If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation.\nHOME NEWS BRANDS & COLLECTIONS\nIKEA's Latest Collection Means Your Pet's Decor Can Be Just as Stylish as Yours\nBy SOPHIA BEAMS\nPublished on 03/22/24\nIKEA\nIKEA has been introducing endless innovative furniture collections this year, from the launch of their tasteful home gym collection to the thoughtfully-designed office furniture line.\nNow, it’s time for IKEA to launch a product range that isn’t for humans at all—the UTSÅDD collection is IKEA’s latest pet furniture collection.\nThe collection remains affordable as ever—one of IKEA’s biggest goals for this year—with prices ranging from just $2 to $70. \nIKEA\nIKEA’s pet furniture isn’t just about looking good, either. The retailer actually consulted veterinarians, product experts, and (of course) the population with the most expertise—a panel of cats and dogs.\nIKEA also took into consideration the needs of pet owners, so all of their pet products are durable, easy to clean, and are designed to blend in with the rest of your home decor. \n“At IKEA, we believe that pets are family,\" said Julia Rosenberg, Product Design Developer at IKEA of Sweden AB, in a press release. \"Our goal was to develop a collection of products that our cats and dogs love and that their human parents can feel good about and truly enjoy having as part of their home.\"\nIKEA\nAs with all of IKEA’s collections, thoughtfulness and practicality are key for the UTSÅDD collection. The theme of the product line focuses on four of the most common activities for cats and dogs: eating, sleeping, playing, and hiding. This means that each piece in the UTSÅDD collection revolves around one (or more) of these activities.\nFor eating, IKEA developed ceramic pet food bowls that are a little heavier than regular food bowls so they’re less likely to slide around, and they’re even dishwasher-safe. The anti-slip placemat means that pet owners will have less time spent on cleaning up messes from spills. \nIKEA\nOne of the trickiest things about pet beds is sourcing items for your pet that don’t clash with the rest of your home decor. IKEA’s pet blankets and beds are designed to blend in so your pet can stay comfortable (and stylish) in any space.\nEven better, these items are water-repellent and machine-washable, so there’s pretty much no better way to ensure cleanup stays simple. \nIKEA\nThe UTSÅDD pet toys are all made from natural rubber and fabric, so your pet can chew to their heart’s content. They’re durable, so you won’t have to constantly be buying replacements, but still soft on teeth and gums.\nIKEA even offers a few options for treat puzzle toys, so dogs can enjoy a little reward for keeping themselves entertained.\nIKEA\nAs for the hiding part of the collection, there are both tent and house options, making it easy to add cat-friendly abodes to your existing furniture. There are even pieces that are designed to fit neatly into the IKEA KALLAX shelving unit. What better way to incorporate pet furniture into your home than that?\nIKEA also used their panel of vets and pet experts to ensure that every product in the UTSÅDD range is completely safe—for both you and your pets. Safety tests are regularly conducted on all UTSÅDD products, and each piece comes with a tag that specifies additional safety instructions.\nIKEA notes that it’s important for pet owners to familiarize themselves with these tags, as they’re there to let owners know if a toy needs to be thrown out after it breaks, or if the owner should be present while their pet uses a particular item. \nReady to get your paws on the UTSÅDD collection? If your pets could read, they certainly would be. The collection launches April 1, and will be available to shop in IKEA stores and on IKEA’s official website."

  "articleText": "GARDENING HOUSEPLANTS HOUSEPLANT CARE\nHow to Make an IKEA Greenhouse Cabinet\nThe trendy IKEA DIY that every plant parent needs.\nBy CORI SEARS\nPublished on 07/28/22\nReviewed by KATHLEEN MILLER\nThe Spruce / Cori Sears\nPROJECT OVERVIEW\nWORKING TIME: 30 mins\nTOTAL TIME: 30 mins - 1 hr\nESTIMATED COST: $300+\nIKEA greenhouse cabinets are the newest IKEA hack that every plant enthusiast needs in their home. Does your space lack adequate light for all of the houseplants that you have (or wish to have)? Are your humidity-loving houseplants struggling in your bone-dry living room? Look no further than a fully equipped mini greenhouse right in your home! Not only are they functional, but these trendy cabinets look great too and are surprisingly easy to make. Plus, like any good DIY the options for your finished piece are truly endless. Ready to dive in? Here’s everything you need to know about making your own IKEA greenhouse cabinet.\nWhat Plants Should Go in a Greenhouse Cabinet?\nA greenhouse cabinet creates a warm, humid environment that is ideal for many different kinds of tropical plants. Aroids like Philodendron, pothos, Anthurium, and Monsteras thrive in greenhouse cabinets, as do orchids, Bromeliads, and other humidity-loving houseplants. Depending on your setup, you can also keep various different kinds of succulents in your cabinet, which will thrive under a grow light. However, if you plan to keep desert cacti and succulents in your greenhouse cabinet it’s best not to use a humidifier as these plants prefer dry conditions.\nThe Spruce / Cori Sears\nWhat Type of Grow Light Is Best for a Greenhouse Cabinet?\nThere is no single grow light that is best for an IKEA greenhouse cabinet as factors like the type of cabinet used, your budget, and the types of plants you are keeping in the greenhouse all matter when it comes to your final decision. That being said, it's usually best to choose a full-spectrum, LED hanging grow light because they are powerful and easy to secure to the top of the cabinet. For this tutorial, we used a full-spectrum hanging grow light. Alternatively, LED strip lights are a great low-cost option that has a small profile and can be secured easily with double-sided tape.\nThe 8 Best Grow Lights of 2022, Tested by Our Experts\nBefore Getting Started\nThe most important thing to consider before starting your IKEA greenhouse cabinet is which IKEA cabinet you will be using. There are four different IKEA cabinet models that are commonly used for these projects: DETOLF, RUDSTA, FABRIKÖR, and MILSBO. These cabinets are popular for greenhouse cabinet DIYs because they are fully contained; made from metal; and have glass doors, sides, and shelves. The model that you choose will largely depend on your space, your budget, and your aesthetic preferences. This article uses the FABRIKÖR tall cabinet, but the instructions can be applied to any of the above cabinet models.\nTip\nLooking for inspiration for your greenhouse cabinet? Search the hashtag #ikeagreenhousecabinet on Instagram or check out @ikeagreenhousecabinet to see awesome IKEA greenhouse cabinets from around the world!\nThe Spruce / Cori Sears\nWhat You'll Need\nEquipment / Tools\nElectric Drill\n¼” - 1 ⅜” Step Drill Bit\nMaterials\nIKEA Cabinet\nTemperature/Humidity Meter\nGrow Light(s)\nMagnetic Hooks\nMini Humidifier\nMini Fan\nInstructions\nAssemble the IKEA Cabinet\nBefore you begin making modifications to the IKEA cabinet it’s best to fully assemble it to get an idea of what the finished piece will look like in your space. Follow the instructions included in the packaging.\nDrill a Hole for the Cords\nOnce the cabinet is put together you will need to drill a hole in the cabinet for the grow light, humidifier, and fan cords. The exact location of the hole will depend on your cabinet model as well as the location of the closest outlet - but for this tutorial, we will be putting it in the top right-hand corner of the removable cabinet bottom. Use an electric drill and a step drill bit to drill through the soft metal. \nSecure the Grow Light(s)\nNext, it’s time to add and secure the grow light in the cabinet. If you are using grow light strips you can simply press them to the top of the cabinet using double-sided tape. Since we are using a hanging grow light, we secured the light using magnetic hooks.\nAdd the Rest of the Equipment\nOnce the grow light has been added you can add in the rest of the greenhouse equipment. This includes the temperature and humidity meter, humidifier, and fan. \nAdd Plants\nNow the fun part! Add your plants (maybe even plants from IKEA) into the greenhouse cabinet. You can add as few or as many as you want, just ensure that you leave some room for your plants to grow into and avoid adding so many plants that they will compete for light.\nTurn on the Cabinet\nFinally, it’s time to turn on your greenhouse cabinet! Plug in your grow light, fan, and humidifier and watch your plants thrive.\nTip\nRather than constantly plugin in and unplugging your grow light(s) every day, use a outlet timer and program the light to turn on and off automatically.\nHow to Maintain a Greenhouse Cabinet\nOnce you have created your IKEA greenhouse cabinet, maintaining it is relatively easy. Keep a close eye on your plants for the first couple of weeks to ensure that they are adapting to their new environment well. Watch for signs of light stress, and ensure that you adjust your watering appropriately. Remember that a greenhouse cabinet usually has higher humidity than the rest of your home (especially if you are using a humidifier) so your plants may require less frequent watering. \nOtherwise, utilize the temperature and humidity meter to monitor the conditions in the greenhouse cabinet. If you notice that the humidity levels have dropped lower than you’d like, you can turn on the humidifier to get the humidity back up. Likewise, if the humidity is too high you can prop the doors of the cabinet open slightly until it has dropped.\nHow to Upgrade an IKEA Greenhouse Cabinet\nThere are many different ways to upgrade your IKEA greenhouse cabinet once it is completed. You can replace the glass shelves with wire shelves (which improves air circulation and allows trailing plants more space); you can add pegboard to the back of the cabinet in order to hang tools and plants; and you can even transform the entire cabinet into a living terrarium if you wish. The options are truly endless and limited only by your imagination!\nIKEA Cabinet Greenhouse Hacks Are the Plant Trend You Should Know"

  "articleText": "HOME IMPROVEMENT KITCHEN REMODEL & REPAIR CABINETS\nWhat Materials Are in IKEA Kitchen Cabinets?\nBy LEE WALLENDER\nUpdated on 12/08/22\nReviewed by JOHNATHAN BREWER\nFact checked by EMILY ESTEP\nIKEA\nIN THIS ARTICLE\nWhat Is SEKTION?\nBox Construction\nSustainability\nStrength\nDoors and Drawers\nBACK TO TOP\nObservers of IKEA kitchen cabinets like to point out that they are not real wood but rather are made from medium-density fiberboard (MDF).\nWhile it's true that IKEA makes extensive use of MDF—they are the biggest users of MDF worldwide—this by no means makes them unique among cabinet manufacturers, nearly all of whom use some form of engineered sheet products in the construction of the basic cabinet boxes.\nAnd it is somewhat inaccurate to say that MDF is not wood, since the material is fabricated from hardwood and softwood byproducts that are bound together with resins and waxes and pressed into sheets under high temperature and pressure.\nMDF is wood to the same degree that plywood is, which is made with glues and resins that bond thin plies of wood into structural sheets for a variety of uses in construction and furniture-making. What some critics call a real wood cabinet is very likely a cabinet made from cabinet-grade (AC) plywood, not solid wood. \nTip\nHiring someone to assemble your IKEA cabinets is a time and sanity saver if you have more than a couple of cabinets to put together.\nIKEA SEKTION Kitchen Cabinets\nIn early 2015, IKEA slimmed its large roster of cabinet lines down to one core cabinet system called SEKTION. For more than two decades prior, AKURUM had been the kitchen cabinet base system, but according to IKEA, the new system \"allows for individual solutions with the excellent use of space and functionality.\"\nBeing more modular, the SEKTION line allows for interior space to be shared among cabinets. And it's easier to add in-cabinet lighting with the SEKTION system.\nIKEA Kitchen Cabinet Box Construction\nThe main body of a base cabinet or wall cabinet is called the cabinet box. As the name says, this is the large, boxy structural part of the cabinet, minus doors, drawers, and all fixtures. It does include working elements that are permanently attached, such as drawer rails and dampers. In IKEA cabinets, the boxes are constructed with: \nMDF for the box core\nMelamine foil (a type of laminate that contains no wood) for the veneers covering the sides of the box. \nHow Sustainable and Eco-Friendly is IKEA's MDF?\nOne point of confusion about IKEA's MDF material is that it is a low-quality type of particleboard prone to instant deterioration. Medium-density fiberboard is not the same thing as particleboard or chipboard, which is made from larger wood chips, bound under lower pressure, and held together solely with glue and resin.\nThe term medium-density fiberboard is the clue: medium. Particleboard is a low-density board, the type used for garage shelves and very low-quality furniture. Another type of board called hardboard is a high-density board that utilizes small particles of wood and is formed under extremely high pressure. Medium-density fiberboard falls between the two, in terms of production methods, quality, and price.\nMDF uses the wood chips and shavings that are wood mills' byproducts. Not only that but MDF makes good use of less desirable softwoods like radiata pine.\nLarger sections of logs are needed to produce dimensional natural lumber, but MDF can use thin branches that are otherwise useless. While not yet found in IKEA's MDF, unique materials such as corn silk, coconut husks, sugarcane, and bamboo can be pulverized and incorporated into MDF panels.\nHow Strong Is IKEA MDF?\nHydraulic press tests of an IKEA MDF door against sections of various species of natural wood prove that natural wood is, indeed, stronger than MDF.\nSpruce fails at 2,227 pounds. The hardwood Paulownia fails at close to 800 pounds. The IKEA melamine-covered panel will fail when subjected to 410 pounds of pressure.\nMaterial  Failure Point\nIKEA MDF 410 pounds\nPaulownia 796 pounds\nBamboo 1,505 pounds\nBirch 1,717 pounds\nSpruce 2,227 pounds\nPine 4,475 pounds\nIKEA Kitchen Cabinet Doors and Drawers\nIn the IKEA system, the cabinet doors and drawers are purchased separately from the cabinet box system. This is what allows consumers to choose the cabinet style they prefer. There are many styles of drawers/doors for IKEA kitchen cabinets, and they fall into four classes of materials:\nClass 1: Natural Wood and MDF\nAt this time, only four lines of IKEA doors contain any amount of real wood, and no doors are made entirely of solid natural wood: the LAXARBY and BJORKET lines (door frames are solid birch; door panels are birch veneer on particleboard), FILIPSTAD line (door frames are solid oak; door panels are oak veneer on particleboard), and EKESTAT line (door edges are solid oak or ash; door panels are oak veneer on particleboard).\nClass 2: MDF and Thermofoil\nThis class is the main category of IKEA doors, with melamine foil and/or thermofoil applied to a fiberboard base: RINGHULT line (fiberboard and melamine foil); GRIMSLOV and MARSTA lines (fiberboard, foil, and melamine foil); BROKHLT, JARSTA, and EDSERUM lines (particleboard and foil); and TINGSYRD and HAGGEBY lines (particleboard, polypropylene, and melamine).\nClass 3: MDF and Paint\nGlossy paint is applied directly to the particleboard for a bright, in-your-face style: VEDDINGE line (particleboard, acrylic paint, and polyurethane), FLADIE line (fiberboard and acrylic paint), and BODBYN and HITTARP lines (fiberboard, acrylic paint, polyester paint)\nClass 4: Glass or Metal\nThese doors may contain some particleboard, but their chief appearance is that of glass or metal: the JUTIS line (glass and aluminum), and GREVSTA line (stainless steel, melamine, and particleboard)"

  "articleText": "HOME NEWS HOME TRENDS\n6 IKEA Shopping Hacks Experts Want You to Know Before Your Next Visit\nBy SARAH LYON\nPublished on 12/02/23\nIKEA\nIf you're planning an IKEA trip in the next couple of months, you'll want to ensure that you're making the most of your visit, no matter whether you've frequented the retail store just once or have shopped there dozens of times.\nTo ensure that you're well-equipped with key shopping hacks that will make your next IKEA outing even more productive, we spoke with Paul Anderson, a home furnishing and retail design leader at IKEA U.S.\nBelow, he shares six insider tips that you'll want to file away for your next store visit.\nMEET THE EXPERT\nPaul Anderson is the home furnishing and retail design leader at IKEA U.S.\nGet the Scoop on What's New at the Store Entrance\nUpon entering an IKEA store, you may be tempted to immediately make your way to a specific department to check a few items off your list, but don't forget to take a moment to browse the entrance area, Anderson urges.\nThere, you'll find information on existing product offerings, store activities, and what’s new at IKEA. Getting a sense of can't-miss recent releases will help you better plan your shopping trip and ensure you don't miss out on these exciting items.\nIKEA U.S.\nBe Strategic About the Day You Visit\nUnsurprisingly, IKEA stores are extra crowded on weekends, so you may be better off saving your shopping trip for your next weekday off of work.\n\"Midweek is the best time to shop if you want more space to experience our many home furnishing solutions and ideas in the showroom, or just have less time to commit,\" Anderson says.\nThat said, don't worry too much about items being out of stock, no matter which day you visit IKEA, Anderson notes that products get replenished on a daily basis. He also says that weekends at IKEA can still be lots of fun if you don't mind a crowd—bring the whole family and enjoy a meal at the IKEA store restaurant.\nMake Note of Some of IKEA's Lesser-Known Items\nWhen you picture an IKEA, large home furnishings and small accent pieces likely come to mind immediately, but note that the store offers more than just these basics.\nAnderson notes that IKEA sells a series of smart home products that are multifunctional, including the STARKVIND side table, which doubles as an air purifier. In the market for smaller gadgets? IKEA sells wireless and portable chargers, too.\nIKEA U.S.\nIKEA's Return Policy Is Quite Generous\nIf you live far away from an IKEA, don't stress about having to plan a return visit within the next couple of weeks, should you change your mind about a purchase once you arrive home.\nAnderson notes that customers can return new and unopened products for up to a year, as long as they also have a receipt on hand. Opened products can be returned within 180 days of purchase as long as they're also accompanied by a receipt.\nBut that's not all—if you're in the process of redecorating your home, you can sell pre-loved IKEA furniture back to your local store in exchange for store credit through the retailer's Buy Back & Resell program. Note that IKEA will only accept items that are still fully assembled and have not been hacked or altered in any way. Upholstered pieces are also not eligible, either.\nDon't Forget to Shop for Textiles\nAgain, while most people associate IKEA with furniture items galore, Anderson encourages shoppers to browse the retailer's home textiles, too—offerings are updated each season.\n\"I always stop in and check out the cushion covers to find new patterns and textiles at the best prices,\" he says. \"You can never have too many decorative cushion covers to update your space!\"\nIKEA U.S.\nIKEA Releases New Collections Four Times Per Year\nNote that IKEA releases limited product collections four times per year. These collections are centered around major U.S. holidays, meaning they're a great opportunity to stock up on all kinds of seasonal goods, ranging from Christmas decor to cozy fall items.\nYou'll be able to find numerous items in various budgets, so you have a range to choose from."

  "articleText": "HOME DESIGN & DECORATING DECORATING FURNITURE REFURBISHING\nThe 6 Most \"Hackable\" IKEA Pieces You Should Add to Your Home, According to Designers\nBy CORI SEARS\nPublished on 10/18/24\nCori Sears\nIKEA is renowned for its stylish, affordable furniture, but its potential for customization truly sets it apart. Here at The Spruce, we love a good IKEA DIY, and as it turns out, so do many interior designers. While spaces filled with IKEA furniture often have a bad reputation in the design world for lacking character and being “cookie-cutter,” interior designers are well aware of the hackable potential of IKEA pieces. \nWhether you’re a seasoned DIYer or just looking to add a personal touch to your space, interior designers have selected six of the best “hackable” pieces from IKEA to spark your creativity.\nMEET THE EXPERT\nLisa Welch is the president and founder of Los Angeles-based Welch Design Studio.\nMagda Callery is an interior designer based in the UK and founder of Style by Magda. \nKALLAX Shelf Unit\nThe KALLAX shelf unit is one of IKEA’s bestsellers, and it’s Lisa Welch’s top pick for the best hackable IKEA pieces. Lisa Welch, president and founder of Los Angeles-based Welch Design Studio, says the KALLAX’s versatility and storage space make it easy to hack. \nIt can be personalized using IKEA products, including baskets, boxes, KALLAX inserts, and more. Take it a step further and transform your KALLAX into a bench with a cushion on top, add a countertop and make it a kitchen island, or paint it a fun color for a brand-new look.\nBILLY Bookcase\nThe Spruce / Letícia Almeida\nBILLY bookcases are arguably some of IKEA’s most hacked pieces. They are affordable, low-profile, and basic—in the best way possible. You can customize them using IKEA products (like adding OXBERG doors) or spruce them up at home.\nPaint and wallpaper are a couple of Welch’s favorite ways to transform BILLY bookcases for her clients’ spaces. They are also a popular choice for DIY built-ins.\nRASKOG Utility Cart\nThe RASKOG utility cart is versatile and multi-purpose on its own, and it can be made even more so with a bit of DIY power. \n“This little trolley isn’t just for kitchen duty!\" says Magda Callery, an interior designer based in the UK and founder of Style by Magda. \"I’ve turned it into everything from a chic bar cart to a mobile craft station.\"\nThis three-tiered metal cart is available in black, white, and mustardy yellow and is set on wheels for easy maneuvering. Don’t be afraid to think outside the box with this one—the possibilities are truly endless.\n“Give it a splash of metallic spray paint, pop on some stylish hooks, and suddenly, it’s hosting cocktail hour,\" Callery says. \"It’s the Swiss Army knife of IKEA—tiny but mighty and always ready for its next role.\"\nMALM Dresser\nThe MALM collection is one of IKEA’s most iconic lines, offering bed frames, side tables, dressers, and more. This collection is beloved for its simple appearance and structure, which makes it versatile and suitable for various spaces in the home. These same qualities make MALM ripe for hacking, particularly the dressers. \n“The MALM dresser may seem basic, but it can turn into a showstopper with some DIY love,\" Callery says. \"Add some trim to the drawer fronts, add hardware, and there you are—you’ve just created a “custom” piece that looks nothing like its flat-pack origins.\"\nHEMNES Shoe Cabinet\nAnother IKEA best-seller, the HEMNES shoe cabinet, is a designer favorite. This piece offers a unique, slim storage solution for footwear that is not easily found elsewhere. Plus, its simple and clean appearance makes it the perfect blank slate for some DIYing.\n“Add some decorative knobs, paint it a bold color, and you’ve got yourself a sleek entryway console that’s secretly hiding all the clutter. It’s the furniture version of a mullet—business in the front, party (or shoes) in the back!” Callery says.\nYou can even join multiple cabinets to create a double—or triple-wide unit that better fits your space. The possibilities are truly endless!\nIVAR Cabinets\nThe Spruce / Meg MacDonald\nAnything in unfinished pine begs for a DIY makeover, so it's no surprise that the IVAR cabinets are popular among interior designers. \n“IVAR cabinets are great for built-in storage or as a desk base,\" Welch says. \"I like to stack them to create unique configurations, and you can add a solid wood countertop for a chic desk surface, blending functionality with style.\"\nDon’t be afraid to pull out the paint or wood stain and have some fun with these pieces. It’s practically what they’re made for."

  "articleText": "HOME NEWS HOME TRENDS\nAn Expert Shares What to Snag and Skip When Shopping At IKEA\nNot everything is worth the affordable price tag\nBy MEGAN MCCARTY\nUpdated on 09/11/24\nA Beautiful Mess\nBrowsing the many, many sections of IKEA can be a staggering experience, especially if you’re shopping in person. From plants and plant accessories to furniture to lighting to dishes, IKEA offers everything you need to furnish a home, all with budget-pleasing affordable price tags. \n\nIf you can make it through the maze of showrooms without getting overwhelmed, the megastore can be a treasure trove—if you know what you’re looking for. Go on a shopping trip with a plan, even if you’re browsing online. Otherwise, IKEA’s low prices may tempt you into adding one of everything you didn’t know you needed or wanted to your cart, and that’s a recipe for a “why did I buy this?” disaster. \n\nInstead, heed the advice of Minneapolis-based interior designer Victoria Sass. According to Sass, some sections of IKEA are full of swoon-worthy steals, with long-lasting materials you should stock up on. Other sections, she says, aren’t worth your time or hard-earned dollars.\nRead on for Sass’s advice on which IKEA categories you won’t want to skip and which sections you should breeze on by. Then, after you’ve made it through the showroom, marketplace, and checkouts, treat yourself to a cafeteria-style meal with IKEA’s famous Swedish meatballs—you deserve it.\nMEET THE EXPERT\nVictoria Sass is a Minneapolis-based interior designer and founder of Prospect Refuge Studios. She frequents IKEA for all of her design projects.\nSnag: Wicker and Rattan Pieces\nThere are two materials Sass always keeps an eye out for at IKEA: wicker and rattan. The versatile and durable materials both age beautifully and bring a natural feel to your home, all without you needing to spend an entire paycheck. \n\n“These are classic pieces that stand the test of time,” Sass says, and she would know—she has been living with (and loving) a pair of lightweight, hand-woven rattan AGEN armchairs for years. Whenever they need refreshing, she simply switches out the throw pillows that top them. \n\nAnother favorite of Sass is the HOLMSTA / FRÖKNABO chairs, which currently live on the aft deck of her houseboat, topped with aftermarket cushions.\nCasa Watkins Living\nDesigners Can't Stop Recommending These Underrated Items From IKEA\nSkip: Upholstery\nWhen it comes to textiles, Sass says it’s a “you get what you pay for” situation with IKEA, so avoid the upholstery section. The economical price tags may be tempting, but chances are it won’t take long before the upholstery starts to look frayed, dingy, and simply cheap.\nCheap materials mean you’ll either be back at IKEA to replace the piece sooner than you’d like, or regret that you didn’t throw down more money on a piece you really love (and will love for a lifetime) in the first place.\n\n“It's hard to do long-lasting upholstery on an extreme budget,” Sass says. “It all starts to show its age very quickly, and the design details just don't do it for me. I come away wishing I would have saved up and splurged on an investment piece every time.”\nSnag: Any Piece of Unfinished Wood Furniture\nAccording to Sass, minimalists and maximalists alike should consider stocking up on raw wood pieces on their next IKEA trip. If you’re not scared off by a DIY project, you can add your own flair to the streamlined pieces with paint or stain. Or, for a Scandinavian-style pared-back look, let the unfinished wood speak for itself. \n\n“We have used birch drafting desks from IKEA at our studio for years, and I personally love the IVAR cabinetry series,” Sass says. “You have to have a little bit of a vision, but these solid wood pieces are great as they are or could be stained or painted for a more personal approach.\"\nUrsula Carmona of Home Made by Carmona\nSkip: Art and Accessories\nWhen it comes to filling your home with meaningful, memory-evoking pieces of art and shelf-worthy accessories, IKEA is just about the last place to look. Walk right past the art section, Sass says, and skip the accessories too. \n\n“These pieces are too ubiquitous,” Sass says. “You don't want to see your art in everybody else's home. It’s better to spend your dollars with local artists and makers for a unique space that tells a story.\"\n\nInstead, slowly collect items that are important to you. What about those doilies your grandmother crocheted? Or that ceramic dish from your trip to Porto? Frame kids’ artwork, or the bar napkin your now-partner scribbled their number on, or anything else that will regularly have you remembering good times."

  "articleText": "HOME NEWS BRANDS & COLLECTIONS\nHold Onto That IKEA Furniture—It Could Be Worth Thousands\nVintage IKEA furniture could make you a fortune at auction\nBy CHRISTIANNA SILVA Published on 12/21/23\ntang90246 / Getty Images\nIKEA is known for being the go-to place to find inexpensive, endlessly hackable furniture. But not all IKEA pieces are inexpensive. \nVintage IKEA pieces can be sold for an inordinate amount of money, particularly considering their relatively humble original pricing. Recently, a selection of 122 vintage IKEA pieces sold for £32,000, or about $35,068, at the world’s largest auction house in Stockholm, Sweden, according to The Guardian.\nMost of the pieces are from the 1950s when IKEA manufactured its furniture in Sweden, but there were some porcelain pieces from the 1990s. One piece, the red Impala sofa designed by Gillis Lundgren, originally sold for about $100—at the auction, that price jumped to over $1,700.\n“There’s a lot of IKEA furniture to which we as an auction house would say ‘No thank you,’” Ulrika Ruding, Stockholms Auktionsverk’s head of applied arts, told The Guardian. “But then there are items that have something special or an unusual story, something to draw a designer’s eye.”\nIt’s no surprise that some of the work sold at the auction was designed by Lundgren, whose work at IKEA includes help creating the IKEA logotype, the catalogue covers, and the famous Billy bookcase. Lundgren’s work spanned across the furniture design space and into photography, as well.\nBeyond Ludgren’s work, other pieces of IKEA’s past have been sold for enormous sums, including the Åke chair, which sold for over $1,500 in 2022, and the Cavelli chair, which sold for more than $15,000—it was originally just around $25 in 1958.\nIKEA Rereleases Are a Big Trend\nLuckily, you don't have to spend thousands if you're coveting one of these vintage pieces, as this trend has come at a time when IKEA is also rereleasing some of their most popular products.\nMost recently, IKEA rereleased the Nytillverkad collection. It was originally launched in the 1960s and 1970s and will be available in stores in January 2024.\n“That is why we decided to bring back a selection of our design icons, and we are excited to see interest coming from customers of all ages, especially young people who are discovering our design legacy and using these vibrant solutions to express themselves at home,\" Johan Ejdemo, the Global Design Manager of IKEA of Sweden, said in a press release about the Nytillverkad collection rerelease.\nUnlike what you can find at auction, though, the pieces in IKEA’s rerelease aren’t the exact same as the original. The new designs are intended to have the same feel as the original but with slight alterations that make it fit with a world decades older. For instance, some of the Nytillverkad collection rerelease includes bolder patterns, brighter colors, and a maximalist aesthetic.\n“The third edition of the collection takes inspiration from a time when youth culture, pop music, and political protests were shaping the world,” IKEA said in a press release. “At that time, IKEA introduced new materials such as painted particleboard and plastic to create furniture with a youthful expression. Bold shapes, optimistic colors, comfortable seating, and soft high-pile rugs characterized the furnishing style of the time, and this new edition of Nytillverkad is launched to let design enthusiasts revisit those days.”\nWhy Collectors Buy Old IKEA Items\nThat’s exactly why people are willing to spend such significant amounts of money on vintage IKEA items—they evoke this sense of nostalgia for folks who grew up with the original pieces. \nOf course, there are plenty of other reasons collectors want to get their hands on these vintage pieces and are willing to pay the price. Some vintage IKEA furniture and home goods simply have really cool and unique designs that stand out, and people want to own those in their home. Plus, older furniture items from all companies are sometimes perceived as being of higher quality and more durable than their modern counterparts. And with anything collectors love, vintage items are, by nature, limited.\nIt’s clear why folks would want to buy old IKEA pieces—and it’s clear they sell pretty well. So if you have the space, keep those IKEA items, just in case."

Though the pieces often feature basic lines and simple structures, they make the perfect blank canvas to personalize, and from that came IKEA hacks.\nThere are countless ways to add some flair to your IKEA purchase that goes beyond giving it a fresh coat of paint or new knobs. With some creativity, you can even completely disguise it and make it look like a high-end find.\nIn this collection, you'll find IKEA hacks that take ordinary dressers, tables, lamps, and shelves and turn them into custom beauties.\nDOCKSTA Table Hack\nA Beautiful Mess\nWhen Laura Gummerman, staff writer at A Beautiful Mess, was ready to upgrade her dining room table, she had her heart set on a tulip base that could seat six people. However, every option she came across was out of her budget.\nSo, she did what every resourceful DIYer does—she made her own. She used the DOCKSTA table base and cut the oval top from her current dining room table.\nAfter mounting the tabletop to the IKEA base, she applied a few coats of eco-friendly, non-toxic lacquer to give a glossy and durable finish.\nIf you want to follow Gummerman's lead, check out the full tutorial.\nBILLY Bookcase Hack\nDrew Michael Scott\nWe've seen several BILLY Bookshelf hacks over the years, but none as transformative as this one by Drew Michael Scott of Lone Fox. He opted to use the version with a birch veneer for this project.\n\"The design was fully inspired by a material I came across called pole wrap,\" he says. \"I really wanted to utilize it in a design and, at the time, was very inspired by curved furniture pieces.\"\nScott got to work by first cutting the curved pieces out of plywood and attaching them to the shelf using L brackets. Then, he covered the sides in pole wrap.\nLucky for us, he offers a detailed tutorial on his YouTube channel.\nKALLAX Shelf Hack\nProject by Alexandra Gater / Photo by Carla Antonio  \nExpert DIYer Alexandra Gater is known for her clever IKEA furniture hacks, and we absolutely love how this one serves a dual purpose. Gater chose to install an IKEA KALLAX shelf in this small studio apartment to act as a divider and storage shelf.\nBy closing the bed in, she created the illusion of a separate room. She gave it a few finishing touches to give it a custom look.\n\"Adding a base to take the unit to the ceiling and covering the edges with molding gives it a built-in effect,\" Gater says.\nSINNERLIG Pendant Light Hack\nCasa Watkins Living\nEven the smallest details can personalize an IKEA piece and give it a total makeover. Take this SINNERLIG Pendant Light Hack by Stephanie Watkins of Casa Watkins Living, for example. She simply attached a few tassels to the SINNERLIG pendant using fishing wire.\nYou can even change out the decor on the lampshade seasonally. Watkins also made a version for spring out of faux flowers, and you could even hang a few lightweight ornaments for winter and fake leaves for fall on there—the possibilities are pretty much endless here.\nRAST 3-Drawer Chest Hack \nUrsula Carmona of Home Made by Carmona\nIf you've spent any time pricing wardrobe systems, you know they're not cheap. Ursula Carmona of Home Made by Carmona hacked her way into her dream wardrobe using two IKEA RAST chests, and she pulled it all off for less than $200.\nShe stacked the units on top of one another and gave them a fresh coat of paint and sleek new handles. She also built two book-shelf-like units to attach to either side, where she installed rods to hang her favorite go-to shirts. Then, she finished the look off by adding trim.\nIf you want to recreate the DIY in your own home, you can follow her tutorial."

  "articleText": "HOME DESIGN & DECORATING DECORATING DIY PROJECTS\nHow to Paint IKEA Furniture So Your Hacks Actually Last, Straight From a DIY Pro\nBy NOMITA VAISH-TAYLOR\nUpdated on 09/24/24\nThe Spruce / Jason Donnelly\nIKEA hacks are always a good idea but sometimes all you want is to change the look with a quick paint job. This could be to refresh an old piece or to transform a brand-new piece to better fit with your color style.\nWhile IKEA's offerings include some pieces in untreated pine, most of their furniture is laminate-covered particle board and laminate is non-absorbent, meaning this smooth surface can be tricky to paint for a lasting finish. But with a little know-how and the right tools and materials, it’s entirely possible.\nHere’s everything you need to know about painting IKEA’s laminate pieces for a professional look and lasting finish. \nWant more design inspiration? Sign up for our free daily newsletter for the latest decor ideas, designer tips, and more!\nWhat You'll Need\nEquipment / Tools\nSanding block or sandpaper\nTack cloth\nRespirator (optional)\nPainbrushes\nDrop cloth\nPainters tape (optional)\nMaterials\nShellac-based primer\nLatex paint (in the color of your choice)\nPolycrylic sealer\nInstructions\nThe Spruce / Jason Donnelly\nDisassemble the Furniture\nIf possible, always paint your IKEA furniture before assembling it. If it’s a new piece, the items will come disassembled anyway.\nIf you’re painting a piece you already own, take as much of it apart as you can including things like the hardware and legs. This will make the whole process much easier and give you a better finish.\nLightly Sand and Clean\nLightly sand all the surfaces that are going to be painted—a 100- or 120-grit sanding block or sandpaper is ideal.\nOnce sanded, thoroughly wipe down all the surfaces with a damp cloth to remove the dust particles.\nPrime the Surfaces\nWhen you’re painting laminate furniture, not only is priming essential but using the right type of primer is key.\nWhen using the recommended shellac-based primer, make sure to work in a very well-ventilated area and preferably wear a respirator for added protection.\nUsing a paintbrush, apply a thin layer of primer to every surface. Allow to dry completely before moving on to the next step.\nYou might need to use some painter's tape before priming especially if your piece is assembled or partially assembled.\nTip\nShellac-based primers are best for laminated surfaces but they are high odor and require usage in well-ventilated areas. A second best option is a synthetic shellac primer that has a low odor.\nApply Paint\nNow it’s time to give your piece some color! Using a brush, apply two coats of paint to ensure good coverage. Allow drying time between coats as per the instructions on your paint.\nFinish With a Sealer\nA sealer will protect your piece of furniture and is essential for furniture pieces with heavy use.\nYou can skip this step if it's a decorative piece or a piece that doesn't see a lot of use. For example, I have painted IKEA mirror frames in the past and haven't sealed them.\nOnce your paint is completely dry, use a brush or roller to apply your sealer to all the painted surfaces.\nDo You Have to Sand IKEA Furniture Before Painting?\nYes and no. If you want a professional-looking finish that will last for years, I recommend doing a light sand before applying your primer. Sanding simply gives a little roughness that helps the primer to adhere better to the surface.\nIt is possible to skip the sanding and still get good results if you use a shellac-based primer that specifies that sanding isn’t required. That said, I’d still recommend a light sand for the best results, especially as it's quick and doesn't require any specialist tools.\nWhat's The Best Kind of Paint for IKEA Furniture?\nPainting IKEA furniture is all about using a primer that is suitable for laminate surfaces and shellac-based primers are the best for this.\nOnce your piece is correctly primed, you can use any paint you like. Latex paints are popular as they offer a lot of color choices and you may have some leftovers lying at home. If you want a more distressed look you can opt for chalk paint. Spray paints are yet another option.\nLightFieldStudios / Getty Images\nTips\nYou can apply paint with brushes, rollers, or foam brushes but from my experience, brushes give the best finish.\nIf using a brush, invest in high-quality brushes. This will save you from having to pick out bristles from your painted surfaces. While the brushes will cost more, with proper care they will last for years.\nIf using a sealer, choose one that matches the finish of your paint. For e.g. use a gloss sealer to go with gloss paint.\nOnce you're done, add an extra day or even two to the recommended drying time before assembling, otherwise you could risk a bit of damage while you're assembling the piece."

The DIYer opted to make two matching units to add balance, style, and storage to the space.\n23\nof 25\nCorner Bookshelves\n@1930shouserevamp / Instagram\nWhat's great about hacking a Billy bookcase is you can design an end product tailored to your needs. And that can include manipulating things a bit to fit a tricky corner spot or angle in your home. The narrow Billy bookcase option can work especially well to fill in odd angles, and it can easily be used in conjunction with the more standard wider version because they're the same height.\n24\nof 25\nHome Office Storage\n@ourhome.becoming / Instagram\nA sophisticated paint color, modern knobs, and traditional trim help to make this hacked Billy bookshelf home office corner unit look more high-end.\nContinue to 25 of 25 below\n25\nof 25\nPantry Shelving\n@little_birdhouseinyoursoul / Instagram\nBilly bookcase hacks aren't just for living spaces.

  "articleText": "HOME NEWS BRANDS & COLLECTIONS\n6 IKEA Shopping Secrets We Learned from an Insider, Including Sections Not to Skip\nBy MEGAN MCCARTY\nUpdated on 07/31/24\nIKEA\nPerhaps no one knows IKEA better than Abbey Stark, interior design leader at IKEA U.S., who has worked with IKEA for 20 years. She designed store environments, developed creative direction, and even launched the IKEA Interior Design Service, which is available for both business and residentail customers.\n\n“It has been a journey I could never have dreamed of,” Stark says. “It has brought me many creative opportunities through innovation and leadership in interior design while cultivating amazing friendships around the globe.”\nGiven Stark's wide range of insider IKEA insight, we figured we should reach out and ask her more about IKEA. We asked her the kinds of questions that true IKEA fans would love answers to. Which section consistently has the best deals? When's the best time to go to IKEA to avoid all that parking lot traffic?\nRead on to discover what Stark has to say. She even told us about her favorite IKEA products.\nMEET THE EXPERT\nAbbey Stark is the interior design leader at IKEA U.S. and owns her own firm, Abbey Stark Design.\nWhat Is the Best Time of Day to Shop at IKEA?\nAccording to Stark, the most peaceful times of the week at IKEA are Sunday and Tuesday evenings. This is when you should go if you like to shop in a less crowded environment.\nThese are the times when you can shop at your own pace with intention, without worrying that you're holding up the crowd or that you yourself will get stuck behind a slower group.\nWant to learn about more of our favorite products? Sign up for our free shopping newsletter for our best sales, top products, and more!\nWhich Section Should You Not Skip?\nAs for a section recommendation, Stark urges that you explore the lighting department. She once dreamed of becoming a lighting designer.\n\n“I can get lost in this area of the store,” Stark says. “I love using statement lighting in my design work, so I am always looking for something new and inspiring.”\nWhat Is the Best Time of Year to Shop at IKEA?\nIKEA\nStark says that spring is the best time of year to shop at IKEA. It's loaded with new goods for the summer season, and spring is generally an excellent time to spruce up the home after a dreary winter.\n\nNew and trendy outdoor furniture, beautiful pots for outdoor plants, and other summer staples flood the shelves at this time.\n\n“It’s bright, happy, and I am always inspired to refresh my home for my favorite time of year, summer,” Stark says.\nWhich Section Has the Best Deals?\nAs for the best deals, Stark thinks more people should know about the \"As-Is\" department. This is where IKEA sells items that have been gently used, possibly as showroom displays, or that have been discontinued.\nThis products have been inspected thoroughly and still function properly. You just might score a steal of a deal. “You can find some great treasures,” Stark says. \nSHOPPING TIP\nIKEA's As-Is Online makes it even easier for you to find deals at home, before you even get to the store.\nWhich Products Should You Not Wait to Buy?\nFinally, Stark wants shoppers to know that limited collections truly are limited. If you have your eye on an item from one of these collections, don't wait. They sell out quickly.\nFor example, the TESAMMANS limited collection has caught Stark's eye. It features tableware, textiles, and even furniture in unique color combinations and bold shapes.\nWhat Are Stark's Personal Favorite Products?\nSEKTION Kitchen System\nIKEA\n“The SEKTION kitchen system is beautiful, functional, and customizable! I love the minimal design aesthetic while offering extreme organization.”\nKOLBJORN Indoor/Outdoor Cabinet\nIKEA\n“I have three of these cabinets because they are perfect for storing pots, gardening tools, and cushions for outdoors.”\nBAGGBODA Side Table\nIKEA\n“Just cool. I love anything that is ‘70s inspired—a little bit of glam and fun to be had in any home.”\nFRÖSET Chair\nIKEA\n“I love the organic shape and the simplicity of this chair.\"\nSKÅLBODA Armchair\nIKEA\n“I love an accent chair. I have a slight addiction of collecting them with no location to place them in my home.”\nDEJSA Table Lamp\nIKEA\n“Beautiful. Enough said.”"

As the collection starts at just $3.99 and extends to $135, home workout equipment has never been this affordable or beautiful.\nIKEA\n\"The philosophy is to help people be more active in their homes,\" says Sarah Fager, senior designer at IKEA of Sweden.\nThe collection launches with 19 items, from 6 lb. hand weights that can double as decor on your coffee table to round activity mats for the whole family. Other standouts include a workout bench that has storage inside and doubles as a table when not in use, a compact air purifier that's only $34.99, a portable bluetooth speaker, and a rolling cart for easy storage of any equipment.\nIKEA\nWith a mix of signature light wood tones and pops of energetic green and yellow, the color scheme is meant to feel fresh and inviting and work in small spaces.\n\"We think that whatever we do needs to be either multifunctional or for small space living,\" Fager says. When you use [these products], they're a training item or they are a recovery motivation item, but when you don't use it, it's something else.\"\nIKEA\nAfter gathering research that women and girls are more likely to drop out of sports and activities, the team at IKEA wanted to design a collection that made working out at home easier.\n\"I think one thing that at IKEA that we are good at, we don't necessarily have the answers how to solve the problems in the world, but one thing we're good at is to screw things together,\" Linus Karlsson, Chief Creative Officer at IKEA of Sweden says.\nIKEA\nThe IKEA team conducted at-home visits to learn what frustrations and needs people had with exercise.\n\"People do like the idea of being able to work out at home,\" Karlsson says. \"People do not think gym equipment is nice looking. You hide it in the closet under the bed. This is a result of us listening to what people want, what they need, and what they dream of.\" \nIKEA\nThough exercise can become all about improving performance and hitting metrics, this collection is meant to open up our ideas of what exercise can mean, especially at home. Playing with your kids or unloading the groceries can be movement too.\nIKEA\n\"If it's good for you, then it's good for you,\" Fager says. \"If the training is dancing for one hour with loud music on, that's your type of training or 15 minutes of meditation or whatever. It's taking care of yourself and you do it your way.\"\nFager's favorite piece from the collection are the exercise mats. With two different sizes in a unique rounded, not rectangular shape, they're great for working out with the family or rolling up and taking to the park for a picnic.\nIKEA\nFager's three daughters often see her doing home workouts and want to participate too.\n\"Now there's room for them to be there and also to inspire them that that you can move your body in so many different ways,\" Fager says. \"It's not only relevant if you do one hour. It can be just small things like in between waiting for the potato to cook.\"\nThe DAJLIEN collection is available in IKEA stores, starting January 2024."

The company has been producing furniture and home goods since the 1940s, so it comes as no surprise that some of the most ardent fans of the brand want to hunt down some of the nearly centuries-old pieces.\nNow, instead of having to hunt down those vintage beauties on eBay, IKEA is relaunching its timeless Nytillverkad collection.\nHGTV’s Jenny Marrs Shares 4 Easy Tips to Make Your House Feel Like a Home\nWith the hunt for vintage pieces being more common than ever these days, it's a no-brainer that IKEA would bring back such a beloved collection—especially with certain IKEA products becoming collectors' items.\n“That is why we decided to bring back a selection of our design icons, and we are excited to see interest coming from customers of all ages, especially young people who are discovering our design legacy and using these vibrant solutions to express themselves at home,\" Johan Ejdemo, the Global Design Manager of IKEA of Sweden, said in a press release.\n\"To us, these products are the essence of democratic design: they are timeless, as they combine a beautiful form, a great function, sustainability, an affordable price, and quality that lasts long”\nIKEA\nThe Nytillverkad collection was originally launched in the 1960s and 1970s and will be available in stores in January 2024.\nThe pieces aren’t the exact same, of course. It’s the third edition of the 80th-anniversary collection, and the pieces are reimagined in new colors and materials to fit our lives better today.\nThe colors are brighter, the patterns bolder, and the vibe is fit for a maximalist. After all, a lot has changed in how we live over the past six decades.\nBut despite the necessary changes and adaptations to fit our current needs, the designs remain timeless. \n“The third edition of the collection takes inspiration from a time when youth culture, pop music, and political protests were shaping the world,” IKEA said in a press release. “At that time, IKEA introduced new materials such as painted particleboard and plastic to create furniture with a youthful expression. Bold shapes, optimistic colors, comfortable seating, and soft high-pile rugs characterized the furnishing style of the time, and this new edition of Nytillverkad is launched to let design enthusiasts revisit those days.”\nIKEA\nThe pieces were originally created by IKEA designers Karin Mobring and Gillis Lundgren.\nMobring was the first female IKEA designer and was regarded as one of IKEA’s most productive and trendsetting designers who created 100 different IKEA products, including the CROMI side table, which will be relaunched as the BAGGBODA side table.\nLundgren helped create the IKEA logotype, the catalogue covers, and not only worked as a furniture designer but also as a photographer for the products he created. His MILA armchair from the original Nytillverkad collection is being relaunched as the DYVLINGE swivel armchair.\nIKEA\nIKEA has been slowly launching new products for this collection, so if you can't wait for these funky green and yellow colorways then you can still get products in other colors on their site.\nPrices range from $5.99 for cushion covers to $249 for armchairs, so there’s financial space for you to find something that fits perfectly with your aesthetic—you just have to wait for the launch in a few weeks.\nIKEA"

But one of the best things about the Swedish-born retailer is how easy it can be to create a cohesive, well-styled space—and on a budget, no less!\nThanks to their streamlined Scandinavian design, all of their pieces work well together, but there are more than a few items that have become fan-favorite home staples. These are the tried-and-true must-have pieces we love the most, and the ones we’ll happily replace if and when needed.\nRead on to find out which nine pieces are beloved fan-favorites.\nIKEA Gladom Tray Table\nIKEA\n$20 at Ikea\nWe couldn’t love this tray table more. It’s small, sleek, and easy to move around the house—or even outside if needed. While it also comes in white and dark gray, there’s something about the matte black that elevates the table entirely. You can use it to place your morning coffee, phone, keys, or even any books that need a spot of their own.\nIKEA VATTENKRASSE Watering Can\nIKEA\nBuy on Ikea\nHere’s a tip from a former plant killer: buying a stylish watering can that you keep out and always in sight makes you a hundred times more likely to actually water your plants. That math isn’t exactly tested, but anecdotally, it’s accurate. This watering can, especially in ivory and gold, might actually be plant-life-saving. Its size also makes it easy to bring it around the house if your plants are scattered throughout different rooms.\nIKEA KNIPSA Basket\nIKEA\n$23 at Ikea\nAs someone who has a slight obsession with woven baskets, almost nothing compares to these cube seagrass baskets. They work in almost any room and fit perfectly on most shelves (especially ones from IKEA). They’re also super-sturdy, so unlike similar designs from other brands, they won’t lose their shape. They'll easily keep the clutter away.\nIKEA ÅRSTID Table Lamp\nIKEA\n$29 at Ikea\nThis little lamp would be lovely in a living room or entryway, but we’re particularly partial to it as a bedside table lamp. Thanks to its more traditional silhouette and its little pull cord, it gives definite upscale hotel vibes. If you love unwinding with a book at night, this lamp will provide you the additional light you may need for reading.\nIKEA LÄTTVIKTIG Oven Dish\nIKEA\n$7 at Ikea\nAll of the five-star reviews should tell you all you need to know about this classic oven dish. It’s lightweight and easy to wash, and it transitions perfectly between cookware and serveware. It’s neutral enough to go with any aesthetic, but its shape keeps it from looking too drab.\nIKEA Glass Carafe with Cork Stopper\nIKEA\n$4 at Ikea\nIKEA is a great place for any and all glassware, but we really love the simplicity of this carafe. The cork stopper makes it particularly versatile—it’s easy to keep filled in your fridge or use for an outdoor meal. It also has a wide enough neck to infuse your water with fresh fruit, which is a common problem when looking for a lidded carafe.\nIKEA BLANDA MATT Serving Bowl\nIKEA\n$10 at Ikea\nYou’ll find this bamboo bowl in the kitchen section, but it’s versatile enough to work in almost every room. Use it in your entryway as a catchall for keys, wallets, and spare change. Stick it in your living room or office as a bit of decorative storage, or keep it on your vanity to hold your daily necessities, like hair ties and jewelry.\nIKEA SOCKERÄRT Vase\nIKEA\n$15 at Ikea\nThis simple vase works in white for a farmhouse vibe or matte black if you’re more contemporary, but either way, it’s one of those simple must-haves. It’s the perfect size to leave out and empty as a decorative accent piece, or it works double-duty as either a vase or a pitcher. \nIKEA TRANSPORTLED Rug\nIKEA\n$8 at Ikea\nIt’s hard to find a decent rug at a low price, but this classic striped option from IKEA does the job nicely. It’s neutral and versatile, so you can easily rotate it between rooms when you’re looking for a refresh."

  "articleText": "HOME DESIGN & DECORATING DECORATING DIY PROJECTS\nHow to Paint IKEA Furniture Like a Pro\nThe Best Paints to Use—and What to Avoid\nBy SHAGUN KHARE\nUpdated on 07/29/24\nfotostorm / Getty Images\nIN THIS ARTICLE\nInstructions\nCommon Mistakes\nCare\nFAQ\nBACK TO TOP\nPROJECT OVERVIEW\nTOTAL TIME: 2 - 3 hrs\nSKILL LEVEL: Beginner\nESTIMATED COST: $50\nIKEA is known for simple furniture that works well for a variety of styles. However, you may be wondering how to paint IKEA furniture to upgrade an existing piece that you're no longer in love with or make a fresh-out-of-the-box piece feel better suited for your home. Painting IKEA furniture is easy but requires some special care and prep work. For this, you'll need a roller, a high-quality paintbrush, or a paint sprayer.\nHere’s how to properly paint your IKEA furniture on your own, including tips to make it look great and last for years to come.\nWhat You'll Need\nEquipment / Tools\nScrewdriver, drill, hammer (optional)\nPaintbrush\nPaint roller\nPaint tray\nTack cloth\nDrop cloth\nMicrofiber cloth\nPaint sprayer (optional)\nMaterials\nPrimer\nPaint\nSealer\n120-grit sandpaper\nPainter's tape (optional)\nInstructions\nHow to Paint IKEA Furniture\nDisassemble the Furniture\nDisassemble the furniture with your tools so it's easier to prime and paint crevices. Lay the pieces on your drop cloth. (You can prime and paint a fully assembled piece, however, some areas may be missed or harder to coat.)\nSand the Surface\nSand the surfaces of the disassembled pieces using 120-grit sandpaper. Sanding the surfaces helps rough them up and create friction so that the primer and paint can get a good, solid grip.\nClean the Surface\nGet rid of dust with a tack or damp microfiber cloth, and wipe the furniture with a dry cloth to collect any remaining debris.\nPrime the Piece\nApply a water-based or shellac primer with a roller or brush. Add a second coat of primer on darker-colored IKEA furniture. Once the primer is applied, allow it to dry overnight before painting.\nPaint Two Coats\nUse painter's tape if necessary to protect areas before you paint and achieve crisp lines. Apply two thin coats of paint for a smoother finish. You can use the same roller you used to prime, a high-quality paint brush, or a paint sprayer.\nWait a few hours before applying the second coat of paint. Then, make touch-ups as needed. Remove the painter's tape. Allow the paint to dry for at least 24 to 48 hours.\nSeal and Dry\nApply a sealer with a paintbrush or a roller brush once the last coat of paint is fully dry. However, if you’re using a roller brush, go over the area with a sponge brush to get rid of any air bubbles.\nLet the furniture dry completely for a day or two before reassembling.\nTip\nIf you want to add an extra coat of sealer for protection, lightly sand the first coat of sealer to remove any bumps and ensure a smooth application.\nHow Not to Paint IKEA Furniture\nNot drying properly: It’s best practice to allow for extra dry time—whether it’s with your primer, paint, or sealer. Allow for an extra day or two between steps to get the best finish.\nNot getting a smooth finish: A super smooth roller brush can do the job well. But, if you’re looking for a more professional finish, invest in a paint sprayer.\nIncorrectly using spray paint: You can use spray paint, contrary to popular belief. Just know that it takes longer to build up layers, so it requires a little more time and patience to get an even finish.\nHow to Make Painted IKEA Furniture Last\nChoose a shellac-based primer for furniture that gets heavy use. This option is the best at protecting against paint chips and scratches.\nMatch the primer finish to your paint finish. This maintains the look and patina of the furniture over time.\nClean the furniture with a damp lint-free cloth. If the furniture becomes wet, it can become marked. Make sure the furniture is dried thoroughly before proceeding.\nUse a light cleaner. Dish soap and water work just fine to clean spills. Heavy-duty cleaners may have chemicals that damage the paint or sealant.\nFAQ\nWhat is the best type of paint to use for IKEA furniture?\nConsider the finish and durability of the paint you want to use on a piece of IKEA furniture. For laminate surfaces, latex or oil-based paint is recommended.\nDo I have to sand IKEA furniture before painting it?\nYes, sand IKEA furniture before painting it. Many of IKEA's pieces are laminate-covered particle board and the paint won't stick to it unless the surface is sanded.\nIs priming furniture before painting necessary?\nYes, priming furniture before painting is necessary for several reasons. Priming covers scratches or blemishes, hides stains, preps the surface for the final paint color, and helps the paint adhere."

With nearly 700,000 likes, this DIY takes a bit of work, but it is worth it.\nHow to Get the Look\nFirst, this creator bought three BISSA shoe storage units from IKEA. Then, she cut up notches in the back, used some adhesive, attached all three with clamps, and screwed them into the wall.\nNext, she cut some NDF and scribed the pieces on the bottom so it would fit all across the bottom and the other places the cabinets meet.\nShe scuff-sanded, primed, and got a big scaffolding board which she cut down to size, sanded it down, and attached it to the top.\nFinally, she picked her favorite sage-colored paint, added new handles, and put her shoes away in her perfect custom storage.\nHack #2: Built In Bookcase\n\nKate Hewitt from @our_bears_home on Instagram did the BILLY bookcase DIY we all know and love—taking the classic bookcases and making them look built-in.\nHow to Get the Look\nThis DIY takes a bit of drilling and a bit of sawing, but it comes out pretty perfect if you do it right.\nBuy the number of BILLY bookcases it’ll take to fill your wall.\nThen, build a little base at the bottom out of wood from the lumbar store, add your built bookcases, and add some trim around the edges of your wall to ensure that your built-ins have something to hold onto.\nPaint the bookcase your ideal color, and there you have it—a built-in bookcase from IKEA.\nTip\nOther creators have done something similar but added a curved edge to the top—you can really make this DIY yours.\nHack #3: A Craft Table For Your Kiddos\nYou can build a corner table for your kiddos to paint, play, and create pretty easily, as Babsi S. of @kreativbabs shows on her Instagram post. All you need is two KALLAX shelves, two properly-sized pieces of wood, and a drill.\nHow to Get the Look\nPlace the shelves where you want the table to begin and end, and add your wood on top.\nMake sure to screw it in tightly, since kids can get rough on their play tables.\nBecause it’s for children, the height is pretty much perfect—all you need to add is a little stool and, if you’re feeling it, some storage baskets.\nHack #4: Dish Rack Book Case\nAll you need for this DIY is one bamboo OSTBIT plate holder from IKEA. At just $4, this is probably the least expensive and easiest DIY we’ve seen all year.\nHow to Get the Look\nHang the OSTBIT on your wall.\nPlace a few lightweight books on it.\nComplete your project to reveal the perfect small book display in your home.\nTip\nThis hack is so popular that even IKEA Belgium posts about it on Instagram.\nHack #5: Kitchen Cabinet Turned Bar Cart\nTay BeepBoop, a creator of all things maximalist DIY, bought one IKEA IVAR cabinet into a beautifully colorful bar cart.\nHow to Get the Look\nCut a hole into one of the doors, install cane webbing, and take the second door off completely.\nThen, fill the holes, spray paint a very colorful gradient onto the wood, and add some wine bottle holders and glass holders.\nFinally, add new handles and some legs."

  "articleText": "HOME NEWS HOME TRENDS\nEasy Hacks That Will Transform Your IKEA Kallax From Basic to Wow\nEven the simplest changes (like adding legs) can have big impact\nBy CLAUDIA GUTHRIE Published on 04/07/21\nKylie Hughes\nIs there anything as satisfying as an IKEA hack? Whether it’s as simple as adding a coat of paint, or if you’re going all-in with the power tools, putting your own DIY spin on your favorite IKEA furnishing, from the BILLY bookcase to the MALM dresser, makes it a one-of-a-kind talking piece. \nOne of the most versatile pieces to hack is anything from IKEA’s Kallax cube storage series. The different sizes, shapes and storage spaces are just waiting for you to put your own unique spin on them. We scoured the Internet for our favorites that’ll get you inspired to DIY yourself.\n5 IKEA Hacks We Loved in 2023 That You Should Try in the New Year\n01\nof 08\nPosh Console Transformation\nVivien Albrecht\nHome decor blogger and Youtuber Vivien Albrecht despised the laminate look of her Kallax unit, so she thought: why not disguise it?\nWith 1” x 2” pieces of pine cut to size, 4” x 4” offcuts for the legs, burlap, primer, latex paint, and magnets, she turned her store-bought storage unit into a cane console fit for a magazine spread. You can check out the entire process from start to finish (and DIY along!) on her Youtube channel. \n02\nof 08\nBookcase to Credenza\nLisa Hassan\nAfter moving into her new home and finding inspiration in Restoration Hardware, Pottery Barn and Arhaus catalogues, home decor blogger Lisa Hassan decided to take the more affordable route and upcycle her old Kallax unit into a stylish credenza. \nShe added legs from Amazon, had wood cut for the doors, framed them with picture frame moulding, and added door hinges and magnetic catches. After sanding and staining everything over about five days, her bookcase was unrecognizable. \n“I never imagined it would turn out so amazing!” she said. “All of my friends and family couldn’t believe that it’s the same Kallax bookcase from our old house!\"\n03\nof 08\nA Bargain Breakfast Bar\nLeah Minett\nDIY blogger Leah Minett wanted a kitchen island for her new flat, but was on a super tight budget. So, instead of dropping money on new furnishings, she took an extra Kallax unit from her living room, flipped it on its side and used Gorilla Glue to add MDF board and moulding to one side. She kept the other side open for easy storage, gave it a coat of paint and added IKEA’s LILLTRÄSK countertop.\nAfter adding two stools (also from IKEA!), she had the perfect breakfast bar for her space. \n04\nof 08\nMake It Luxe\nKylie Hughes\nWhen decorating her music room, furniture hacker Kylie Hughes couldn’t find the perfect credenza to match her husband’s black baby grand piano. After spending hours looking through magazines, furniture stores, and designer websites with no luck, she decided to customize a Kallax into exactly what she wanted.\nHughes built the Kallax and door inserts, attached legs she found from Pretty Pegs, added handles, and attached glamorous gold-style panels for a chic look. \nContinue to 5 of 8 below\n05\nof 08\nA Kitchen Island, But Make It Mobile\nDaphne Kampani\nDIY vlogger Daphne Kampani had always wanted a kitchen island, and when she moved into her little apartment she had the perfect opportunity to make one herself. She was looking for three elements: lots of storage, a large surface area and the ability to move it from room to room. \n“That’s why we opted for two 2” x 2” Kallax units instead of one bigger one (the 2”x 4”)—so that we could move at least one of the two units to the living room or patio and use it as a buffet trolley when we have people over,” Kampani said in an email. \nShe fastened wheels to the bottom of each unit, cut and glued a countertop, then joined the two units with a magnet. Within a few hours, she was done!\n06\nof 08\nLevel-Up With Legs\n@shiftabrick\nHome decor blogger Bethan is no stranger to an IKEA hack. This simple (but gorgeous!) DIY is one of many. She added legs purchased from Amazon, placed wicker baskets, and voila—a storage unit that looks totally high-end. You can watch it all come together in her Instagram reel.  \n07\nof 08\nA Mid-Century Makeover\nRyan Battles\nIn his search for a stand for his vinyl collection that didn’t look like it came straight out of a dorm room, Ryan Battles turned a run-of-the-mill Kallax unit into a mid-century modern statement piece. He added 4” hairpin legs and reinforced the back with two 1” x 4” pieces of lumber to keep the records from sliding out the back. The best part: it only took him an hour.\n“Adding the hairpin legs to the Kallax was the perfect blend of style and cost-effectiveness,” he said. “I wanted to make the upper shelf one long shelf because I had speakers that I needed to position and didn’t want them to take up a whole square, so this setup allowed me to showcase the album art in the center and place the speakers to the sides.”\n08\nof 08\nStylish Display Unit\nAlyssa Depew\nHere’s another example of how a small detail—like adding legs—can give your IKEA piece an elevated (literally) look. DIY blogger Alyssa Depew took her love for modern furniture and desire to display items in a fun way and turned it into a budget-friendly, beautifully styled shelf.\nShe found a four-pack of legs on Amazon for only $30, drilled them in, and, two hours later, had a shelf that looks more like a sophisticated display case for keepsakes than a place for storage."

  "articleText": "If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation.\nHOME NEWS BRANDS & COLLECTIONS\nIKEA's TESAMMANS New Collection Will Inject Some Much-Needed Color Into Our Homes\nBy SOPHIA BEAMS\nPublished on 03/01/24\nIKEA\nIKEA is a home goods retailer that knows how to help people revamp their spaces. There’s pretty much no aesthetic that IKEA pieces can’t create, and the retailer has been significantly expanding their stock (and lowering their prices) over the past year. Their latest collection was announced on February 28th, with IKEA preparing to officially release it in April.\nThe TESAMMANS collection is all about big, bold colors. It’s basically an amalgamation of all the most popular aesthetics of the year; think dopamine decor and maximalism. TESAMMANS is like a modern art piece expanded into an entire home decor collection.\nIKEA\nThe new product line was created in collaboration with Raw Color, a Dutch studio created by two artists that—as the name implies—is focused on working with bold color combinations.\nThe studio sells artwork and some household items on their website, but they’re significantly expanding this lineup (and making it more accessible) through their partnership with IKEA.\n“We have an emotional and intuitive approach to color, exploring how different shades interact to enhance each other,\" says Christoph Brach of Raw Color, in IKEA’s official announcement \"Colors are never alone; they need company and it’s much like a recipe where finding the right balance is key for an object to truly sparkle.”\nIKEA\nTESAMMANS is more than just a home product line—each product is truly its own art piece, designed to be examined and viewed in different ways and spaces throughout the home. IKEA’s announcement exemplifies this with the TESSAMMANS rolling storage unit; it’s moveable not just for practicality, but also because the piece itself changes as it moves. It uses a moire effect to give the piece pattern and color that moves with the storage unit.\nEach piece in the TESAMMANS collection is similarly designed; the practical uses of many items in the collection are also turned into ways for the artists who designed the collection to create new elements of visual intrigue.\nThe idea of the collection is about how color can transform the spaces we live in, bringing joy to a room, but also about how color itself can be transformed within a single piece. Many pieces in the collection will change colors or effects as you examine them based on lighting, distance, and movement, creating a much more visually interesting home layout.\nIKEA\nJust like with popular home design color theories—like TikTok’s viral ‘unexpected red’ theory—TESAMMANS focuses on pairing colors together in a way that changes how the eye perceives each color.\nTESAMMANS mixes different tones and shades of color to create new ways color combinations can play off one another, literally changing how the mind perceives each individual shade. It’s no wonder the collection took two years to design.\nThe eighteen-piece TESAMMANS collection won’t be a permanent IKEA staple, unfortunately—it’s limited-edition, so keep an eye out for its official launch in April. It will be available to shop in-person and online at IKEA’s official website."

  "articleText": "If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation.\nHOME NEWS BRANDS & COLLECTIONS\nIKEA's Fall Collection Feels Like a Warm Hug—13 Pieces We Love Under $30\nBy ASHLEY CHALMERS\nUpdated on 09/13/24\nIKEA\nIf the thought of IKEA brings forward visions of all-white rooms and Scandi minimalism, we have news for you.\nThe beloved home brand has launched its fall decor collection, called HÖSTAGILLE. It’s bright, bold, and absolutely adorable, in our opinion. And who isn't ready to start decorating for fall? \nWhile we’ve always loved IKEA, we truly can’t get enough of their latest decor pieces. And although we’d be perfectly happy with one of everything, we scoured the collection for our top faves. \nWant more of our favorite products? Sign up for our free shopping newsletter for our top finds, best sales, and more!\nGlass Pumpkin Bowl with Lid\nIKEA\n$20 at Ikea\nAs far as traditional autumnal motifs go, you can never go wrong with pumpkins. This decorative glass bowl has a traditional feel to it, and we love that it can be used to store seasonal trinkets or set out with a string of lights inside for some ambiance. \nSide Plates in Mixed Colors\nIKEA\n$15 at Ikea\nOrange, purple, gold, and green are all signature autumnal colors, but we’re used to seeing them in jewel tones. The fact these side plates fall on the more muted end of the palette makes them feel instantly fresh, and we love the wavy edges that can’t help but inspired thoughts of pumpkin pie. \nDecorative Pumpkins, Set of Five\nIKEA\n$9 at Ikea\nBelieve us when we say this: assorted decorative pumpkins are a must-have for fall. You can use them as pops of autumnal cheer on everything from your mantle to your bookshelves to your coffee table, but they’re also excellent to reach for if you’re in a tablescape pinch. We adore the color variety of this set.\nOrange Dish Towel\nIKEA\n$2 at Ikea\nYou might feel limited in terms of seasonal decor for your kitchen, but it’s nothing some well-placed dish towels can’t solve. We love both the color and the pattern on this pick, and can imagine it hanging from your oven door, within reach of the sink, or laid across a table for a seasonal pop of color. \nPatterned Storage Box with Lid\nIKEA\n$15 at Ikea\nIf you’ve never considered how to inject some seasonal love into your fall organization efforts, that changes now. These adorable storage containers are a great way to add some color and fun to your open shelving, glass-front cabinets, or bathroom cabinets.\nGray Glass Bowl\nIKEA\n$11 at Ikea\nWhether you use this glass bowl as a functional piece for movie night snacks or as a decorative accent to fill with gourds, we love this bowl. The geometric shape and the moody gray color both feel festive, and it’s the perfect piece for getting into the Halloween spirit. \nBat Motif Door Mat\nIKEA\n$15 at Ikea\nThe truest sign that Halloween is here is a festive front door. While you can make the whole scene pop with pumpkins and fresh potted flowers, our favorite piece will always be a festive doormat and this bat-covered pick is not exception. \nBlack and White Striped Cushion\nIKEA\n$5 at Ikea\nWide black and white stripes are generally considered to be a classic, timeless pattern any other time of year, but at Halloween, we can only think of one thing: Beetlejuice. This feels particularly on-trend right now, and we love when neutral colors can make such a bold impact. \nBlack Decorative Tray\nIKEA\n$8 at Ikea\nDecorative trays and catchalls are always a must, whether you’re setting them out in the entryway or on other side tables. We especially love to swap them out seasonally, and this black option looks great when styled with twinkly lights and festive pumpkins. \nOrange and White Paper Napkins\nIKEA\n$3 at Ikea\nWhile seasonal decor is a must for hosting parties and events, there’s something to be said for elevating your day-to-day, too. These adorable paper napkins are a sweet way to upgrade your autumnal table for the foreseeable future, even if its only you and your household to enjoy it. \nArtificial Garland\nIKEA\n$7 at Ikea\nFrom now until the new year, you can’t go wrong with garlands for setting the scene. We love them draped across mantles, curled around candles, or hung over doorways, and this one is simple, sweet, and understated. \nBlack Candelabra\nIKEA\n$13 at Ikea\nOf course, candelabras aren't inherently spooky, but with the right accessories, they certainly can be. Add jewel-toned tapered candles, faux spiderwebs, or even just an array of glittering gourds, and this pick could look extremely festive. On the other hand, it can also easily transition into a more traditional candelabra, perfect for year-round use.\nSpiced Pumpkin Scented Candle\nIKEA\n$4 at Ikea\nAs far as we're considered, it's not officially fall unless we've added two key elements to our homes: candlelight and pumpkin spice. This glass beauty checks both boxes at once, and we love the orange pumpkin shape as an added bonus. Best of all, it offers two wicks, which is another great way to amp up the cozy ambiance."

Not only does it help you stack your plants for a better display, but the pot sizes are also layered largest to smallest, helping you cultivate a stylish plant arrangement.\nLooking for something that can hold more plants? The 56-inch slatted wooden plant stand is a great pick. It has two shelves for displaying potted plants and a long bar across the top from which you can hang plants, too. \nIKEA\nPlant Care\nDAKSJUS also offers plenty of ways to care for your plants (in style, of course). The collection's self-watering inserts look like an elegant garden ornament, but they also slowly release water from the top of the insert into the soil. Whether you’re worried about caring for your plants on vacation or just struggle to remember to water them, these self-watering inserts will blend right in with the rest of your plant decor.\nThat’s not the end of the self-watering lineup, though—IKEA also offers two self-watering plant pots of different sizes, perfect for plants that need a little extra love. \nIKEA\nPretty Plant Pots\nIt’s worth taking a peek at the regular plant pots in the collection, too. There are a variety of colors and sizes available, all of which come with a chic ribbed exterior.\nIn the DAKSJUS collection, regular plant pots come in sets of two or four, with varied colors. Their miniature pack of four cheerful pots is only $12, while a larger set of two comes in at just $14. It’s an easy (and quality) way to house plants that are still in their plastic nursery pots.\nIKEA\nThe collection also shows off a set of two hanging planters (perfect for adding to the slatted wooden plant stand we were talking about earlier). The set is available in two colors: white and light green. \nIKEA\nGardening Accessories\nFinally, if you’re in the mood to add a few extra accessories to your collection, the DAKSJUS patterned apron and matching gardening gloves are perfect for any outdoor (or dedicated indoor) gardener.\nThe apron comes with plenty of pockets to store any gardening tools, while the gardening gloves offer three sizes and are only $6. \n\"The DAKSJUS collection is about the joy of planting and growing,\" reads the retailer's official website. \"So gather family and friends, unleash your creativity, plant and fill your home with plants, color and joy.\"\nReady to upgrade your plant collection with DAKSJUS? The collection is available to shop online at IKEA and is also in select stores for a limited time only."

Of course, exactly how to decorate your space for the season may be trickier than it seems. As you’re deciding which route to take, why not consult your zodiac sign?\nOur zodiac signs can provide some insight into our personalities, habits, and preferences. For example, some may lean toward traditional or upscale, creating centerpieces out of pumpkins and gourds, whereas others may opt for a more whimsical approach of woodland creatures and bolder colors to set the tone for the season.\nWhether you’re an energetic Aries or an idealistic Pisces, we’ve gathered the best tips for how you should decorate your home for fall.\nWant more design inspiration? Sign up for our free daily newsletter for the latest decor ideas, designer tips, and more!\n01\nof 12\nAries: Upgrade Your Tablescape\nHost to Perfection\nAs a Mars-ruled fire sign, you’re not afraid to take initiative. While it’s certain you’ll end up tackling every corner of your house with decor, try starting with the center of most festivities: your kitchen or dining room table.\nAdding fresh florals in a fall decor scheme, a dose of small pumpkins or pinecones, and decorative napkins in fall colors and patterns can elevate your gathering space instantly.\n02\nof 12\nTaurus: Bring Out the Cozy Fabrics\nS.U.S.A.P\nAs a Venus-ruled earth sign, you know when the temperatures drop, it’s time to start getting cozy. You’re all for keeping warm, but you also enjoy indulging in quality fabrics, so adding blankets and pillows made from velvet, wool, cashmere, and fleece are perfect choices. Choosing accents in festive hues will send it over the top.\n03\nof 12\nGemini: Add Some Plaid\nEmily Henderson Design / Photo by Sara Ligorria-Tramp\nAs a Mercury-ruled air sign, you are well-versed in trends that accompany anything, including the seasons. Adding variations of plaid—a quintessential fall pattern—can help pull things together for the autumnal season.\nOf course, don’t let this keep you from experimenting with adding other patterns and styles to the mix to keep things as eclectic as you are.\n04\nof 12\nCancer: Set the Mood With Candles\nHerzen Stimme\nAs a Moon-ruled water sign, you know the importance of creating ambiance when you’re decorating for the fall season. Candles are a simple yet effective way to light up your space; whether you choose fall scents like pumpkin and vanilla or opt for tapered candles in autumn tones, you can set the tone for fall with a few well-placed options around your home.\nContinue to 5 of 12 below\n05\nof 12\nLeo: Turn Your Mantel Into a Statement Piece\nHomestead City Dwelling\nAs a Sun-ruled fire sign, you know that places like your mantel are prime real estate for decorating. Whether you choose to keep it minimal or go all out, adding garland, pumpkins, and other fall accessories can serve as a centerpiece for the room that you can use to guide the rest of your seasonal decor choices.\n06\nof 12\nVirgo: Spruce Things Up With Seasonal Produce\nAshley Montgomery Design\nAs a Mercury-ruled earth sign, you know that sometimes decor is closer than you think—it could even be in your kitchen. While you may not whip up fall-inspired dishes every day, a sign as prepared as you will likely have the ingredients hanging around, so why not display some of the more seasonal options? Placing squash and eggplants in a festive basket on your counter is a subtle nod to the season without overdoing it.\n07\nof 12\nLibra: Use Dried Seasonal Florals\nEmily Henderson Designs / Photo by Sara Ligorria-Tramp\nAs a Venus-ruled air sign, you love creating beautiful, balanced spaces. While florals are always a go-to for fall decor, using dried seasonal bouquets or stems of pampas grass, wildflowers, or hydrangeas as opposed to fresh can ensure your decor scheme looks cohesive and lasts longer without having to regularly switch out dying flowers.\nWhile you can showcase them in a vase or wrapped in fabrics, you can also take a page from Emily Henderson’s book and display them upside down from the ceiling for a new twist.\n08\nof 12\nScorpio: Use Moody Accents\nErin Williamson Design\nAs a Pluto-ruled water sign, you know how to incorporate dark tones and aesthetics into your space without it appearing gloomy or uninviting, and autumn is an ideal season for those elements to shine. Whether you opt for a dusky wall color or choose wall art and accents that reflect a subdued autumn feel, you can’t go wrong with embracing a darker aesthetic.\nContinue to 9 of 12 below\n09\nof 12\nSagittarius: Decorate Your Outdoor Space\nKirsten Diane\nAs a Jupiter-ruled fire sign, you know decor isn’t just for indoors—your outdoor spaces are full of potential. Depending on the amount of space you’re working with, keeping things simple with strategically placed pumpkins and festive accents can liven up an empty area.\nIf you have a balcony or patio, a few candles, fall-themed throw pillows, and decorative lanterns can create a cozy space to enjoy the crisp fall temperatures all season long.\n10\nof 12\nCapricorn: Use Simple Fall Touches\nEmily Henderson Designs / Photo by Sara Ligorria-Tramp\nAs a Saturn-ruled earth sign, you know that a little goes a long way with decorating. While there is no shame in going all out, a minimalist mindset involving a few bold fall accents among a neutral backdrop or simple additions like neutral-toned pumpkins or pinecones can add the perfect amount of fall with minimal effort.\n11\nof 12\nAquarius: Try a Unique Fall Color Scheme\nStudio Peake\nAs a Uranus-ruled air sign, you enjoy taking typical trends and adding a twist. Rather than sticking with your usual fall colors of burnt orange and mustard yellow, try a unique fall color scheme, such as deep jewel tones in blue and green. Pairing the color with other fall decor can set your space apart from the usual fall decor photos you find on Pinterest.\n12\nof 12\nPisces: Add Fall Accents to Your Shelf\nEmily Henderson Designs / Photo by Sara Ligorria-Tramp\nAs a Neptune-ruled water sign, you know personalization is key to making decor choices. Taking your shelves and cabinets and adding some fall accents you’ve hand-picked for the space, such as vintage books, amber glass vases with pampas grass, or seasonal artwork, can make a huge difference."

  "articleText": "CLEANING & ORGANIZING ORGANIZING GARAGE & ATTIC ORGANIZATION\n18 Garage Bike Storage Ideas to Save Space\nBy MARIA SABELLA\nPublished on 01/03/23\nCometary / Getty Images\nWhether you love going on long leisurely bike rides or a bike is your daily mode of transportation to get to work, storage can pose a challenge. Multiple bikes can quickly clutter a space and when not stored properly, they can easily fall over or take up much more room than necessary. Creating a streamlined system to store bikes in your garage will not only make them look neater, but it will also keep them from getting damaged and help you access them faster. From suspending bikes from the ceiling to installing a bike rack or hanging them on the wall, we're sharing 18 clever garage bike storage ideas to help you save space.\n01\nof 18\nSuspend a Bike From the Ceiling\n@afreshspace / Instagram\nIf you're short on square footage in your garage, consider suspending your bike from the ceiling. This is a safe and space-saving storage solution that doesn't take up any extra room. Check to make sure there's enough clearance for your car if you park it inside the garage—then install two rubber-coated metal hooks in the ceiling to hold your bike.\n02\nof 18\nMount Bikes Using Wall Hooks\n@afreshspace / Instagram\nThink vertical and mount multiple bikes on the wall one next to the other using bike hooks. Measure the length of your bike to know how high to position the hook on the wall—then hang the back wheel on the wall hook with both the tires flush against the wall and the bike seat facing away from the wall.\n03\nof 18\nStore Them Under Shelving\n@afreshspace / Instagram\nLean bikes against the wall under shelving to utilize space that would otherwise have gone unused. If you are planning on installing open shelving in your garage, measure the height of your bike and leave enough clearance between the ground and the bottom shelf to accommodate one or multiple bikes.\n04\nof 18\nUse a Peg Board\nJodi Jacobson / Getty Images\nA peg board is an incredibly useful and versatile addition to a garage and another clever bike storage solution. Install hooks from the peg board and mount bikes on the wall horizontally to keep them off the ground and neatly put away.\nContinue to 5 of 18 below\n05\nof 18\nPark Bikes in a Bike Stand\n@afreshspace / Instagram\nA bike stand is a multipurpose storage solution that's freestanding and doesn't require extensive installation. Instead of drilling holes in the wall or ceiling, simply position the stand against the wall and it's ready for use. A bike stand typically has slots to park multiple bikes as well as a handy shelf to hold helmets and other accessories.\n06\nof 18\nUse a Horizontal Bike Mount\n@afreshspace / Instagram\nHang bikes on the wall horizontally one above the other using bike mounts. They are typically adjustable when it comes to their length and angle, so that you can hang adult and kid-sized bikes from one central beam that can also hold the coordinating helmet.\n07\nof 18\nKeep Them in a Corner\n@afreshspace / Instagram\nWhen mounting bikes on the wall or suspending them from the ceiling is not an option, designate one corner for bike storage. Park them one behind the other along the wall, or next to each other depending on what your space allows.\n08\nof 18\nHang Bikes From a Tire Tray\n@afreshspace / Instagram\nMount a tire tray on the wall to hang bikes vertically. This system comes with two metal trays—one for each bike tire—to keep your wall clean from any mud on the tires.\nContinue to 9 of 18 below\n09\nof 18\nHang Helmets on a Peg Board\n@nycneat_louisa / Instagram\nBesides being a great option for hanging bikes, a peg board is also an excellent spot to store bike accessories such as helmets.

  "articleText": "HOME DESIGN & DECORATING ROOM DESIGN BEDROOMS\nHow to Choose the Right Area Rug for Under Your Bed\nFinding the Right Size and Style for Your Home\nBy MICHELLE ULLMAN\nUpdated on 11/09/24\nThe Spruce\nIN THIS ARTICLE\nWhat Should Sit on the Rug?\nSmall Bedrooms\nLarge Bedrooms\nUnder Dressers?\nChoosing Style and Material\nKeeping Your Rug in Shape\nFAQ\nBACK TO TOP\nAn area rug can elevate your space by bringing in some color, texture, and pattern while also providing your feet a soft landing when you wake up every morning. Whether you decide to layer your area rug under your bed to muffle sound or to make your space look instantly bigger, it's essential to pick the correct size so everything looks proportional.\nQuick Tips\nAn area rug can be a great way to add an infusion of color to your space, cover high-traffic areas, or make a room look bigger.\nWe've gathered some easy guidelines you can follow when it comes to choosing the right one, so your area rug fits perfectly in your space.\nWhat Should Sit on the Area Rug?\nThe Spruce / Jason Donnelly\nA square or rectangular area rug works best under any size bed. However, if you have other furniture by the foot of your bed, you may need to make a few choices about what goes on top of your area rug. If you're trying to fit everything on top, you will need to opt for a bigger area rug. There are four options when it comes to placing an area rug under your bed:\nOnly the entire bed frame sits on the area rug.\nThe entire bed frame, nightstands, and a bench at the foot of your bed all sit completely on the area rug.\nOnly the lower two-thirds of the bed, plus a bench at the foot of your bed, sits on the area rug, which leaves the head of your bed and any nightstands sitting on the bare (or carpeted) floor.\nOnly the lower third of the bed, plus a bench at the foot of your bed, sit on the area rug, leaving most of the bed on the bare floor. More of the area rug will jut out into the rest of the room. This option works best if you're laying a smaller area rug down over carpeting to give the room color and texture.\nYou don't want to end up with half of the furniture sitting on an area rug because it can look slightly lopsided and unbalanced when you sit down.\nArea Rug Sizes for a Small Bedroom\nMichelle Boudreau Design\nIf your bedroom is small, you could always get a small bedroom area rug for the side of your bed, Instead, think big when it comes to bedroom rug ideas. In a smaller room, select a rug that's large enough to nearly fill up the entire space and it will visually enlarge the room. Be sure to leave between 2 inches and 5 inches of bare floor between the rug and the walls.\nIf you have a twin-size or full-size bed in a small room, use these general guidelines for the size of the area rug you'll need. Note that twin-size beds typically measure about 39 inches wide by 75 inches long (a twin XL, designed for taller people, measures 80 inches long). A full-size bed, or double bed, measures 54 inches wide by 75 inches long.\nA 4-foot by 6-foot or a 5-foot by 8-foot area rug fits the bottom two-thirds of the bed only.\nA 6-foot by 9-foot area rug fits the bed, a nightstand, and a bench at the foot of the bed.\nA 9-foot by 12-foot area rug fits two twin-size beds, one nightstand in the center of the two beds, and two benches at the foot of each bed.\nArea Rug Sizes for a Large Bedroom\nThe Spruce / Joules Garcia\nChoosing a rug that's too small for a large bedroom will throw the space off balance. If you do choose a large rug that fills up most of the room, leave at least 8 inches of space between the edges of the rug and the walls.\nIn a larger room, you may have a queen-size or king-size bed. Use these rough guidelines to choose an area rug that will look good in a big bedroom. Take into consideration the measurements of larger beds. A queen-size bed measures 60 inches wide by 80 inches long. A king-size bed measures 76 inches wide by 80 inches long. A California king-size bed measures 72 inches wide by 84 inches long.\nAn 8-foot by 10-foot or 9-foot by 12-foot area rug will fit the bottom two-thirds of a queen-size or king-size bed, but not the nightstands.\nA 12-foot by 15-foot rug will look balanced under the longer California king-size bed, and this size area rug will even fit under nightstands.\nA general rule of thumb suggests that an area rug should always extend at least 18 inches to 24 inches from the sides and the foot of a queen-size and a king-size bed.\nArea Rugs Under Dressers\nThe Spruce / Michelle Becker \nRegardless of the size of your bedroom or bed, an area rug should not push up against the edge or legs of a dresser or other large piece of furniture. Choose a rug large enough to fully slip underneath the entire dresser. Or, pick an area rug small enough so you can leave at least 2 inches or 3 inches of floor showing between the edge of the rug and the piece of furniture.\nChoosing Style and Material\nArea rugs come in all styles, textures, materials, and pile heights. The best bedroom rugs are typically plush and high-pile, and the most comfortable types of area rugs for bedrooms are soft cottons, smooth silk blends, sumptuous polyesters, and eclectic faux furs. A wool area rug may be strong, warm, and beautiful in a more formal or traditional-style bedroom.\nDecide if you want your area rug to be calming and grounding or a splash of drama in your bedroom so you can choose an appropriate color and pattern.\nRug Pads and Maintenance\nThe Spruce / Michelle Becker \nEven when your area rug is under the bed, the edges can still bunch up to cause a tripping hazard. Double-sided carpet tape is one of the best solutions. Alternatively, a nonslip rug mat placed under the entire area rug will keep the edges down.\nConsider placing a rug pad underneath your rug. A rug pad has numerous benefits, such as adding another layer of soft cushioning underfoot, reducing noise in the room, and insulating the space from a cold subfloor. A felt rug pad is cushiony while a rubber rug pad will help the rug better stay in place on a bare floor.\nKeep your area rug looking new with the right maintenance. An area rug under the weight of a bed will become indented. Take care to turn your area rug every so often so you can remove the indentations with an ice cube treatment. Let a small ice cube melt on the indentation, then fluff up the fibers with your fingers. Just be sure you thoroughly dry the spots you've iced so you don't accidentally step into a puddle of cold water in the morning.\nBest Area Rug Roundups\n16 Area Rugs We Love For Every Type of Decor\nAfter Testing Washable Rugs, Here Are the Best We Recommend\nThe 8 Best Rug Pads of 2024, Tested and Reviewed\n1 of 2\nFAQ\nWhat size rug should go under a queen-sized bed?\nA rug under a queen-sized bed should extend 18 to 24 inches beyond the edges of the bed. This would generally be a 5-foot by 8-foot or a 6-foot by 9-foot rug.\nCan you layer an area rug over a carpeted bedroom?\nYes, you can layer an area rug over a carpeted bedroom. In addition to adding warmth, style, and personality to a space, layering an area rug over carpeting is a great approach for renters or for anyone who needs to replace the carpet but doesn't have the budget for it at the time.\nWhat does an area rug under a bed do for the room?\nAn area rug under a bed helps protect the floor from your bed. It can also reduce noise, hide any imperfections, add warmth and coziness to the room, and add to the overall decor/ambiance of the space.\nWhat's the best shape of rug for under your bed?\nGenerally, a rectangular rug is best for under a bed, however, a round rug can also work if it extends far enough to reach your nightstands."

Creating an inviting entrance doesn't need to be a huge undertaking. It might be as simple as adding one container or plant.\nMix in different types of plants, such as flowers, vines, evergreens, and seasonal plants. Also, pick plants that work best with your doorway's sun exposure, from full sun to shady porches. Using containers allows great flexibility and makes changing plants to match the seasons easy.\nCheck out these ideas for creating a striking and welcoming entrance with the help of plants.\n01\nof 40\nLush Begonias\n@contained_creations / Instagram\nThese matching pots at a shady entrance are full of vivid hot pink begonia x hybrida 'Dragon Wings' begonias, which bloom profusely and colorfully in the shade. Keep them deadheaded, and they'll bloom all season long. Most begonias are perennial in zone 9 or warmer, although hardy varieties can overwinter outdoors in zone 6 or warmer.\n02\nof 40\nDwarf Hinoki Cypress\n@contained_creations / Instagram\nThe cool color palettes of these planters look great against the red brick house in USDA zones 5 to 8, where it grows best. The blues, purples, and greens mostly come from foliage (ornamental cabbages, heuchera, dwarf evergreens, and grasses), with just a few flowers mixed in. Give these plants a lot of sun to keep them thriving.\n03\nof 40\nTrailing Creeping Jenny\n@contained_creations / Instagram\nAlthough the ferns are the main attraction of these semi-shady doorway planters, the pops of color from the petunias and the streaming creeping Jenny (Lysimachia nummularia) keep the eye engaged, elongating the planter's top-to-bottom interest.\nMost ferns need a shadier spot; although creeping Jenny and petunias prefer more sun, they can adjust to a partial sun spot. The best part about creeping Jenny is it's hardy to zone 4 to 9. While annuals only last the warm weather months in cooler zones, keep Jenny in your planters if you live in a cooler climate.\n04\nof 40\nColorful Caladiums\n@contained_creations / Instagram\nWhy is pink such a popular color in the garden? For starters, it creates a bold color contrast with green. But pink is also thought to be a very soothing color. This juicy assortment of pink flowers and plants stars caladiums in this windowbox with a supporting cast of impatiens, angelonia, and lantana. Caladiums are warm-weather plants that prefer warmer zones 9 to 11 and filtered light or partial sun to shadier spots.\nContinue to 5 of 40 below\n05\nof 40\nFantastic Ferns\n@kirsten.diane / Instagram\nThis front porch entrance's simple yet striking look is easily achieved with symmetrical placements of pots of ferns and other plants with dark green foliage that match the front door's color. Kimberley Queen or Boston ferns are an excellent choice for a doorway planter, and feng shui practitioners also favor ferns. They need warmer temperatures, like USDA zones 9 to 11, to return as perennials and prefer filtered or partial sun exposure.\n06\nof 40\nCaptivating Coral Bell\n@contained_creations / Instagram\nThis planter has a diverse and rather inspired blend of textures and shapes, with some plants that are solid and eye-grabbing, like the thick, maroon coral bell leaves, and the airy and delicate (the pink 'Clara Curtis' chrysanthemum, among the grasses. Coral bell (heuchera) grows well in USDA zones 4 to 9, preferring shade since the sun can wash out the colors of foliage.\n07\nof 40\nClustering Evergreens\n@contained_creations / Instagram\nThis collection of potted evergreens looks classy and vibrant, a fine choice for a display that rides the transition from late autumn into winter. Consider dwarf arborvitae or globe arborvitae to make a statement. Although they have \"dwarf\" in their name, some can grow 12 feet tall. These planters' blue-green foliage and earthy colors create a pleasing and neutral palette. These plants can handle cold temperatures down to zone 2, preferring full sun or at least four hours of direct sun exposure daily.\nTip\nEvergreen shrubs must be cold hardy to at least two USDA hardiness zones lower than your zone to thrive in a container.\n08\nof 40\nContrasting Impatiens\n@contained_creations / Instagram\nRed and green aren't just for Christmas. Opposites in the color wheel, reds, and greens complement each other. The cherry red of these impatiens is a vivid contrast to the lime green of the sweet potato vines, and the olive brown vines and darker greens of leaves and grass balance the brightness. Impatiens need a shadier spot and the warmth of summer to grow well (USDA zone 10-11).\nContinue to 9 of 40 below\n09\nof 40\nStalky Banana Tree\n@contained_creations / Instagram\nA delightful blend of shapes, textures, and colors accentuates the beautiful glazing of these ceramic pots. The 'Blood Banana' tree contains brown and green tones, while the silvery ivy and pastel purple blooms play up the pale aqua. Banana trees are tropical plants that require the heat of zone 9 to 11 and full sun exposure to grow well.\n10\nof 40\nVining Ivy\n@contained_creations / Instagram\nThis windowbox is planted with flowers and plants that incorporate trailers or spiller plants. Ivy is a go-to vining plant perfect for hanging baskets too. This collection features chrysanthemum flowers, kale, heuchera, and ivy in muted but rich colors that stand out boldly against a white background. The subtle tones of brown, purple, orange, and green create an earthy, warm palette of autumnal beauty. When planting ivy, make sure it has a shady spot. Although temperatures are rarely an issue, it grows well in USDA zones 4 to 13.\n11\nof 40\nFlowering Mandevilla\n@contained_creations / Instagram\nA climbing vine can be a wonderful accent plant if stairs lead up to your entrance. This cheery pink mandevilla can be grown as a frost-tender perennial in warm climates or as an annual in colder climates. This plant prefers the sun to the shade, growing as a perennial or returning plant only in tropical zones 10 to 11. Be sure to provide an adequate structure for support because some vines can be quite aggressive or invasive (such as Japanese or Chinese wisteria).\n12\nof 40\nPerfect Pumpkins\n@marieflaniganinteriors / Instagram\nHaving a door painted a dark color means finding ways to brighten up the area with decor. The brass and copper wall sconces and fittings are a perfect addition. In the autumn, the warm oranges and bright whites of pumpkins and flowers complement the deep grey and lighten the entrance with color.

This blue-green beauty blends nicely with some English ivy and creeping thyme with its fragrant, delicate, tiny leaves. Except for all-green varieties, the cooler the temperature, the more colorful the cabbage will become. These plants thrive in USDA zones 2 to 11.\n14\nof 40\nStrappy Cordyline\n@s.u.s.a.p. / Instagram\nThis small hotel in an Italian village decorates its entrance on a cobblestone street with multiple containers of various sizes and at varying heights, full of lush flowers and cascading grasses. like liriope, cordyline, or hakone grass. The colorful annuals in the containers enhance the pastel walls. Cordyline grows in USDA zones 9 to 11, preferring a lot of sun, although direct sun might be too strong, so give it a rest with afternoon shade.\n15\nof 40\nRounded Boxwoods\n@contained_creations / Instagram\nWith a wide staircase entrance, there's plenty of space to create a dramatic display with containers. This autumnal design includes large dramatic planters with cascading ivy, colorful burgundy heuchera, and a tall spiral evergreen topiary with a bittersweet vine wound around it, along with pots of dwarf boxwoods and hardy chrysanthemums. Boxwoods (USDA zone 5-9) can handle full sun, although they prefer dappled light in the hottest, sunniest zones.\n16\nof 40\nTextured Hydrangeas\n@ladylandscape / Instagram\nThis striking modern house has a large front yard area softened with multiple plantings. The soft, delicate textures of hydrangeas, astilbes, and grasses balance the house's angular lines, while the differing shades of green provide a rich infusion of color. Hydrangeas grow in USDA zones 5 to 9, thriving in partial sun locations with some shade protection and extra water during the hottest days.\nContinue to 17 of 40 below\n17\nof 40\nBillowing Pussy Willow\n@contained_creations / Instagram\nThese grand planters are overflowing with assorted spring annuals and sprightly ivy. The center features cut pussy willow stems, a spring favorite that can be replaced with other flowers as the season progresses. Pussy willow shrubs grow best in USDA zones 4 to 8 and consider growing them in full sun, although they will tolerate some shade.\n18\nof 40\nBountiful Periwinkles\n@contained_creations / Instagram\nThis charming swan container adds a touch of whimsy to this entrance. The assortment of white flowers, using flowering plants like periwinkle or heliotrope, matches a swan's natural color, but plants in other colors work nicely, too. Plants like periwinkle grow as perennials in USDA zones 4 to 9. They can tolerate all sun levels from full sun to full shade but thrive in the best partial sun location.\n19\nof 40\nProlific Petunias\n@burcharddesignco / Instagram\nHanging baskets are a quick and easy way to add flowery drama to your entrance. Maybe you're still working on your garden area or just don't have time this season to get it together. These big baskets of lilac pink petunias are eye-catching and low-maintenance. Petunias will flower all season but need the sun for the most profuse flowers. These plants grow best in USDA zones 10 to 11, so do not expect to see them return in cooler zones.\n20\nof 40\nDramatic Dracaena\n@leafandlolo / Instagram\nVisitors to this home in Barcelona, Spain, are welcomed by an eclectic assortment of dragon tree plants and closely related foliage, which stands out as a vibrant accent to the entrance. Some of these plants, like dracaena (USDA zone 10-11), must be brought inside for winter since they prefer hot weather year-round.

The bright colors pop against the house's neutral whites and shutters' grays. These plants love the sun but need some protection during periods of intense sun. These plants go dormant in the hottest and coldest months and are grown as tender perennials in USDA zones 7 to 11.\n23\nof 40\nMassive Mums\n@kirsten.diane / Instagram\nThough we often associate deeper, richer colors with autumn decor, these pastel shades offer an unusual view of the autumnal aesthetic. The pale orange pumpkins and chrysanthemums are a great choice to accent the pale wood of the door and bamboo chairs, and the abundance of white is fresh and unexpected. Mums flower the best in full sun, although they can tolerate partial shade. These perennials will return annually in USDA zones 3 to 9.\n24\nof 40\nSnappy Snapdragons\nkrblokhin / Getty Images\nSnapdragons and snapdragon lookalikes, angelonia, are popular short-lived garden perennials usually grown annually.

Most palms, like this one, are tropical, requiring warmer zones (USDA zone 9 to 11) to survive outside year-round. Most palms also need full sun or, at the very least, partial sun to thrive. Areca palms are another tropical choice but require even warmer temperatures, growing best in zones 10 to 11. Sago palms are a hardier choice, surviving temperatures down to zone 8.\n26\nof 40\nHardy Geraniums\nThe Spruce / Kerry Michaels\nWhat makes geraniums unique is their dark green foliage, often contrasted with richly hued flowers that draw attention immediately. Hardy geraniums (Geranium) are an excellent choice for cooler USDA zones (3 to 9). Also called cranesbill geraniums, they have true blue flowers, unique to these types of geraniums, with many varieties of blue, violet, and purple to tease the peepers. Hardy geraniums differ from zonal geraniums (Pelargonium), which require warmer temperatures and come in red, white, and pink tones.\n27\nof 40\nScented Sage\nThe Spruce / Kara Riley \nSage plants are full sun perennials in the salvia family in zones 4 to 8.

Keeping these plants in containers ensures that they don't spread invasively.\n30\nof 40\nSunny Coneflowers\nJacky Parker Photography / Getty Images\nSome doorways are bathed in sun, so get light-worshipping flowers like daisies, coneflowers, and black-eyed susans that live for the sun. These plants in the aster family are hardy, perennial, and drought-tolerant once established. They grow in USDA zones 3 to 8, returning each year offering a sunny disposition.\n31\nof 40\nTowering Tulips\nThe Spruce / Sarah Crowley\nFlowering bulbs erupt in color and are a sign that spring has sprung. A sun-seeking tulip is a full-sun plant that sparks joy at the doorway. These bulb plants are hardy down to zones 3 up to 8.

These plants can become invasive in some warmer zones, so potting them in containers is an excellent way to contain and control their growth.\n34\nof 40\nSucculent Kalanchoe\nThe Spruce / Adelyn Duchala\nKalanchoe, sedum, and other succulents like the sun, although they occasionally prefer a break, especially on super hot sun days. These plants grow best in USDA zones 10 to 12, taking well to growing in a container and making a doorway statement. Kalanchoe also produces pretty flowers, although it needs abundant sun to produce enough energy to spur blooming. Most succulents, like kalanchoe, are drought tolerant, often storing moisture in their thicker stem systems.\n35\nof 40\nSpring Daffodils\nThe Spruce / Evgeniya Vlasova\nThe trumpet-shaped heads of daffodils like following the sun. These bulb-flowering plants make a colorful statement in yellow, cream, and orange hues. They grow in USDA zones 4 to 8 and flower in early spring. Daffodils don't rebloom, so if you plant them at your entranceway, consider pulling up the bulbs after the stems shrivel. Look at planting a summer selection of plants with daisies, marigolds, or coreopsis.\n36\nof 40\nFlourishing Astilbe\nThe Spruce / Evgeniya Vlasova\nAstilbes produce perennial, long-blooming flowers with plume-like stalks of flowers in shades of white, pink, purple, and red. These low-maintenance plants can grow in all levels of sunlight but will need some cover during the hottest, sunniest days. This plant returns every year in USDA zones 3 to 8.

Queen Elizabeth roses are a good choice for a doorway for several reasons. These full-sun roses are among the easiest to grow, with good disease resistance and a welcoming fragrance. They are hardy to USDA zones 5 to 9. There is also a climbing variety of Queen Elizabeth roses, with dark green, robust leaves and light pink flowers growing on trellises, fences, and pergolas.\n39\nof 40\nSilvery Dusty Miller\nMax Labeille / Getty Images\nPlants with a silver sheen have a nice effect when grown together. Consider growing a collection of dusty miller, silver king artemisia, lamb's ear, snow in summer, or sage grouped for a stunning effect. Silver and purple or blue flowers also look stunning with silver, so consider adding a flowering plant to the mix.\nAll these plants do well in full or partial sun, although they prefer more sun to less. Dusty miller grows as a perennial in USDA zone 8 or warmer, although if given a little winter protection, it can come back in slightly cooler zones.\n40\nof 40\nWhimsical Bougainvillea\nThe Spruce / Kara Riley \nBougainvillea are some of the most striking climbing, vining flowers to grace an entranceway. You can't go wrong with these plants if you have full sun exposure and an arbor or trellis flanking the doorway. These South American-native plants produce pink, purple, red, orange, white, or yellow flowers, growing as perennials in warmer zones from USDA zones 9 to 11.\nHow to Choose the Right Plants for Your Front Door\nChoosing the right plants for containers can be overwhelming, with so many choices available. The thriller (tall central feature plant), the filler (medium-sized plant with a fuller, fluffier texture that creates the bulk of volume), and the spiller (trailing plants that spill over the side of the container, like ivy) are popular three-pronged design approaches.\nLet your creativity guide you to choose colors, textures, and shapes you enjoy in combination. When planning your overall design concept, consider the colors and shapes of the area where the containers will be placed."

Laying out a brand-new rug can change a room’s aesthetic, all while adding inviting texture underfoot. And, since we’ve spent hours testing area rugs in The Lab and at home, we know what makes for an eye-catching, comfy area rug.\nAfter testing more than 130 area rugs of all shapes, sizes, and materials, we’ve learned the best ones really come down to personal preference. If you’re looking for a low-maintenance synthetic option that will hold its own against stains and spills, we’ve got you covered. Or, if you prefer a luxe and comfortable natural option, we’ve included those too. \nOur Top Picks\nBungalow Rose Samaniego Hand Tufted Oriental Rug at Wayfair $86\nJump to Review\nDash and Albert Herringbone Flatweave Rug at Amazon $828\nJump to Review\nHouse of Hampton Darrold Geometric Rug at Wayfair $64\nJump to Review\nRifle Paper Co.

It’s made with wool fibers, but when we put it to the test at home, we were impressed with the material’s soft feet. It felt less scratchy than your typical wool rug (or even blanket) and nicely comfortable underfoot.\nWe also liked how densely-packed the wool is on this area rug. It doesn’t feel plush, but it does feel wonderfully cushy and comfy to walk on barefoot, making it a great accent piece for hardwood floors. Plus, over the course of our testing, its thickness made the pile perfect for a lot of foot traffic. It sprung right back up into shape after pressure was applied, too.\nWhile we did discover that the area rug’s pile and wool fibers didn’t hold up well to pet claws, and it was prone to shedding, these are pretty common features of any wool rug. Overall, though, it was easy to vacuum, held up well in the face of everyday wear and stains, and added both style and warmth to our home.\nPile Height: 0.5 inches | Material: Wool, viscose | Size Range: 2 x 3 feet to 9 x 12 feet | Shape: Square, rectangle, and round\n The Spruce\nDash and Albert Herringbone Flatweave Rug\nPHOTO: Herringbone\n$828 at Amazon\n$634 at Wayfair\n$11 at Annieselke.com\nIf you’re searching for a low-pile area rug, this herringbone one from Dash and Albert is one we really liked in our testing. In our home, the thinner nature of the rug allowed it to lay perfectly flat, and yet it still offered a decent amount of underfoot comfort atop our floors.\nWe particularly like that this cotton rug is designed to be reversible, which gives you a choice in how it’s laid out and which side you prefer to have facing up. On either side, the soft nature of the cotton fibers made it inviting, and it held up well to typical foot traffic. We would, however, recommend using a grippy rug pad underneath, as the cotton did make for a slippery surface on hardwood floors.\nJust note that the colors do vary quite a bit from what you see online. While the rug appeared navy and cream in retailer photos, it looked more beige in-person when we unrolled it.\nPile Height: 0.25 inches | Material: Cotton | Size Range: 2 x 3 feet to 10 x 14 feet | Shape: Rectangle\nHouse of Hampton Darrold Geometric Rug\nPHOTO: Wayfair\n$64 at Wayfair\nNeed an area rug that can withstand a lot of traffic or extra-messy pets and kids? A synthetic performance rug like this one from House of Hampton is the perfect choice. Made with polypropylene fibers for extra durability, this rug can withstand just about everything you throw its way.\nWith high-pile fibers and a versatile, eye-catching geometric pattern, this rug looks like any cotton or wool option. But its 1.5-inch thick fibers feel cushiony underfoot, and they can withstand frequent foot traffic in your entryway, hallway, or any other area at home. When we tested this rug, we particularly liked how well it handled traffic and found it nicely pleasant to walk on barefoot.\nHowever, it’s worth noting that we did find it difficult to clean. While it’s great for walking on, its long fibers make it a bit tricky to vacuum; you’ll need to shake it out to get rid of crumbs, fur, and other debris.\nPile Height: 2 inches | Material: Polypropylene | Size Range: 2 feet 3 inches x 8 feet to 11 x 15 feet | Shape: Rectangle, square, and round\nRifle Paper Co. Provence Joliette Power-Loomed Rug\nPHOTO: Rifle Paper Co.\n$360 at Amazon\nView on Riflepaperco.com\nView on Rugs-direct.com\nWith a gorgeous floral pattern and dark-hued background that can expertly hide dirt and potential stains, we found the Provence Joliette Rug from Rifle Paper Co. to be a standout option in our testing. When we laid out this rug, we liked its thin profile and low pile. Made with synthetic materials, it’s still soft underfoot.\nWe also liked how the pile height and surface texture of this area rug varied a bit according to the pattern. It offered some visually interesting details, but it was still perfectly pleasant to walk atop.\nIn terms of durability, we definitely found this rug held up to frequent traffic, and it even survived being clawed at with a sharp-bristled brush (so we think it would handle pets’ claws, too.) We also found that stains and small debris like coffee grounds were a breeze to clean up, making it a great pick for messier or more frequently used rooms at home.\nPile Height: 0.13 inches | Material: Polypropylene, polyester | Size Range: 2 feet 6 inches x 4 feet to 9 x 12 feet | Shape: Rectangle\nPHOTO: The Spruce Home / Henry Wortock\nRugs USA Diamond Trellis Nursery Rug\nPHOTO: Rugs USA\n$86 at Rugsusa.com\nFeaturing a classic and versatile diamond trellis pattern and a wonderfully dense wool pile, we like this area rug from Rugs USA for any high-traffic area. When we tested this rug, we liked the comfort it offered as well as the true colors that appeared identical in person to what we browsed online.\nWhile the rug didn’t initially lay flat on the floor when we rolled it out (one corner kept curling up), we did find it added a nice layer of cushioning underfoot. We also liked its value, as it’s a quality rug with solid durability at a reasonable price.\nThough it’s designed as a nursery rug, we think it would perform well anywhere in your house. Its densely-packed fibers hold up well to foot traffic, and it handles everyday care like vacuuming like a champ.\nPile Height: 0.45 inches | Material: Wool | Size Range: 2 feet 6 inches x 8 feet to 8 feet 6 inches x 11 feet 6 inches | Shape: Rectangle and round\nThe Spruce / Katie Begley\nHow do you get an area rug to stay flat?\nIf you're having trouble getting your area rug to lay flat, you can purchase a non-slip rug pad. This will help keep the floor underneath your rug from getting damaged and keep your area rug from sliding around when walked on. Or, for a budget-friendly solution, you can try rug anchors or adhesives that stick underneath the corners of your area rug.\nPottery Barn Chunky Knit Sweater Rug\nPHOTO: Pottery Barn\n$399 at Pottery Barn\nThick, soft, and impressively heavy, Pottery Barn’s Chunky Knit Sweater Performance Rug impressed us when we rolled it out at home. Since it’s designed for both indoor and outdoor use, we put this area rug to the test in both environments. We liked how much cushioning it provided underfoot, and we found it could even pad your feet against small rocks.\nHowever, we think this rug would make a particularly good addition to indoor spaces. Its thickness and durability offer great advantages in high-traffic areas. And it did have some drawbacks when used outdoors; sticks, leaves, and other outdoor debris got caught in the fibers and were difficult to remove.\nIndoors, however, we think it holds up well to everyday wear. We also really liked its strong grip, which ensures you don’t have to worry about curling corners or a slipping rug that might cause tripping.\nPile Height: 0.5 inches | Material: Wool, viscose, cotton | Size Range: 4 x 6 feet to 12 x 18 feet | Shape: Rectangle, square, and round\nPHOTO: The Spruce / Henry Wortock\nRugs USA Rhea Modern Abstract Rug\nPHOTO: Rugs USA\n$110 at Home Depot\n$172 at Rugsusa.com\n$145\n$131 at Kohls.com\nIf your neutral-colored furniture set needs a bit of liveliness, consider a bright, geometric rug like this pick from Rugs.com. Hues of orange, blue, and yellow come together on a beige canvas to pull attention and interest to the center of your living room, while the tassels on both sides add a bohemian, playful element. This design is also available as a runner for empty hallways and is designed to be pet-friendly and easy to clean.\nPile Height: 0.90 inches | Material: Polyester | Size Range: 2 x 3 feet to 9 x 12 feet | Shape: Rectangle\nDash & Albert Diamond Geometric Rug\nPHOTO: Dash & Albert\n$538 at Amazon\n$538 at Wayfair\nView on Perigold.com\nIt’s particularly important to choose a stain-resistant rug in dining areas and highly-trafficked rooms. A synthetic indoor/outdoor rug like this one is a great choice for these spots since it's durable and easy to care for.\nThis geometric, handwoven rug is fade-, stain-, weather-, and mildew-resistant. Plus, the pattern helps mask any stubborn spots that may linger after cleaning. Use it in your kitchen, dining room, entryway, patio, covered porch, or three-season room. Customers give this rug high marks for its affordable price, soft texture (even on bare feet), and durability.\nPile Height: 0.25 inches | Material: Polypropylene | Size Range: 2 x 3 feet to 12 x 16 feet | Shape: Rectangle\nPHOTO: The Spruce / Carrie Bluth\nAdvertisement\nAshler Home Faux Sheepskin Rug\nPHOTO: Amazon\n$27\n$17 at Amazon\nIf you love the look of a classic sheepskin rug but are worried about the upkeep, we suggest opting for the Ashler Faux Fur Rug. Made with faux sheepskin and a suede non-slip backing, this high-pile rug laid perfectly flat the first time we rolled it out at home, and we were impressed at how little it shed during its first weeks of use.\nWe were even more impressed by the look and feel of the rug in person. While the rug looks nice online, we found it appeared even loftier and felt silky soft to the touch, making it even more luxurious and cozy. And when we put it through wear and tear, we discovered it handled pet claws and foot traffic quite well, losing fewer fibers than we expected.\nThe non-slip backing did fail us slightly, as the area rug did move a bit with certain motions. However, we think this is something you can easily remedy with a gripper pad placed underneath.\nPile Height: 2.8 inches | Material: Polypropylene | Size Range: 2 x 2.9 feet to 6 x 9 feet | Shape: Varies\nPHOTO: The Spruce / Henry Wortock\nJonathan Y Moroccan Hype Boho Rug\nPHOTO: Amazon\n$163\n$107 at Amazon\n$107 at Home Depot\n$107 at Lowes\nThis classic area rug has a bohemian feel that blends seamlessly with any living room decor. It has a simple diamond motif that looks gorgeous yet understated in eight attractive colors. The synthetic material and low pile won't trap dirt or fade over time, so it's perfect for high-traffic areas of your home.\nIt's machine-woven, so the fibers won't stain or shed. Be sure to buy a rug pad as well, so it will stay put and won't slip under your feet. To keep it clean, the brand recommends vacuuming regularly and spot cleaning as needed.\nPile Height: 0.31 inches | Material: Polypropylene | Size Range: 2 x 3 feet to 9 x 12 feet | Shape: Rectangle, square, oval, and round\nAllModern Walker Checkered Shag Rug\nPHOTO: AllModern\n$145 at Wayfair\n$145 at Allmodern.com\n$449 at Havenly.com\nYou might not think synthetic rug fibers and a classic shag area rug go together, but we loved how AllModern’s Walker Rug delivered on softness, coziness, and all-around performance. We found the shag and high pile felt consistent with other shag rugs we’ve tested, and we loved how soft and thick it felt to walk on.\nWhile there is no non-slip backing on this rug (and it definitely slides around, so don’t skip the pad!), we found it held up to foot traffic decently well. It was just as soft and inviting after six months of use as it was on day one of our testing, and we really liked the amount of comfort it added to our hardwood floors. \nWe were also happy to discover that regular care was easy; the thickness of this shag area rug was enough to keep it in place even during vacuuming, and its quality never wavered with care.\nPile Height: 1.3 inches | Material: Polypropylene | Size Range: 2 feet 7 inches x 8 feet to 8 feet 9 inches x 12 feet | Shape: Rectangle, square, and round\nOphelia & Co. Nuss Oriental Rug\nPHOTO: Amazon\n$30 at Wayfair\nMade in Turkey, this highly rated rug resists stains, fading, and moisture, making it a no-brainer option for living rooms and bedrooms. Plus, the attractive design is available in tons of sizes and colors to fit your space perfectly. We're partial to the circular option for unique living room setups for office nooks. Ophelia & Co uses OEKO-Tex-certified materials, so you can ensure your rug is free from harmful toxins and chemicals. While it's not machine-washable, it's built to be extremely durable, so bring on kids, pets, and any other messes you can imagine.\nPile Height: 0.375 inches | Material: Polypropylene, jute, sisal | Size Range: 2 feet 6 inches x 4 feet to 12 x 18 feet | Shape: Rectangle, square, and round\nAdvertisement\nAllModern Ovid Oriental Woven Area Rug\nPHOTO: AllModern\n$65 at Wayfair\n$159 at Allmodern.com\n$159 at Havenly.com\nWith a low pile and thin profile that make it easy to roll up and move, we really liked AllModern’s Ovid Rug in a home with pets. This area rug, which features eye-catching Oriental styling and vibrant colors, was a standout in how it handled fur. The low pile made it easy to vacuum, and when placed in a hallway that sees decent foot traffic, maintained its quality over time.\nHowever, we did find that after six months of use, stains and spots were a bit tricky to remove, so you may need to enlist the help of professional cleaners to get it looking fresh after dirt develops. That’s pretty common with large area rugs, so we weren’t too surprised by this slight drawback.\nPile Height: 0.13 inches | Material: Viscose | Size Range: 3 feet 11 inches x 5 feet 7 inches to 7 feet 10 inches x 10 feet 9 inches | Shape: Rectangle\nPHOTO: The Spruce / Henry Wortock\nRuggable Gradasi Rug\nPHOTO: Ruggable\nView on Ruggable.com\nWashable area rugs are a particularly great addition to homes with a lot of traffic and frequent messes—or, frankly, any home that wants an easy-care rug! We love Ruggable’s Gradasi Premium Rug, which is made with synthetic fibers and a polyurethane water-resistant barrier to keep liquids off your floors. \nFeaturing a rug cover and a grippy, non-slip rug pad, Ruggable’s area rug can be tossed in the wash for an easy cleanup any time spills, stains, or general spots of dirt accumulate. Plus, we loved how easy it was to get both the pad and the rug to lay flat at home; first-time setup and post-wash were both simple to accomplish.\nWhile we did notice some pilling after six months of testing, this area rug continued to impress us with its cushioned underfoot feel, its durability, and its overall appearance with regular washing.\nPile Height: 2 millimeter (flatwoven) or 7 millimeter (tufted) | Material: Polyester, polyurethane | Size Range: 2 x 3 feet to 9 x 12 feet | Shape: Rectangle and round\nRevival Dawn Ombre Rug\nPHOTO: Revival\nView on Revivalrugs.com\nWith an attractive ombre pattern and a soft, inviting texture underfoot, we really liked Revival’s Dawn Rug when we tested it at home. It provides a nice pop of color wherever it’s placed, but it’s still subtle enough to suit a variety of decor styles. \nFeaturing wool and cotton fibers, we were immediately impressed by the density of the rug. We loved that it laid out completely flat as soon as we rolled it out, and it feels high-quality in every aspect. While it does shed (a detail common to most wool rugs, we’ve found in our testing), that shedding should diminish over time.\nWe also liked how easy the rug was to clean. While wool rugs can vary quite a bit in how they handle spills, stains, and general dirt, we found Revival’s area rug was both easy to spot clean and clean with a handheld carpet cleaner. We did struggle a bit with pet hair since the rug’s pile is so thick, but a handy pet hair rake did the trick for more thorough cleaning.\nPile Height: 0.33 inches | Material: Wool | Size Range: 4 x 6 feet to 10 x 14 feet; custom sizes also available | Shape: Rectangle\nPHOTO: The Spruce / Henry Wortock\nSafavieh Milan Shag Accent Rug\nPHOTO: Amazon\n$43\n$37 at Amazon\n$334 at Walmart\n$633\n$44 at Target\nIf you’re looking for an area rug that mimics the feel and thickness of traditional carpet, Safavieh’s Milan Shag Rug is a great option. It’s less traditional shag rug and more like inviting carpeting underfoot, providing some cushioning and comfort to hardwood floors.\nWhile this isn’t the most style-forward area rug on our list, it does do a great job at warming up a room, both stylistically and physically. We loved the texture and the pile height of the rug, and its color choices offer plenty of versatility so you can add it to any room. After months of testing, we found it held up nicely well to foot traffic, too, handling wear from young kids and adults well without looking worn.\nPile Height: 2 inches | Material: Polypropylene | Size Range: 2 x 4 feet to 11 x 16 feet | Shape: Rectangle, square, and round\nPHOTO: The Spruce / Henry Wortock\nHow We Tested the Area Rugs\nOver the past few years, we’ve tested over 130 area rugs in The Lab and our homes to find the best ones that combine style, comfort, and durability. We’ve tried options made from a variety of materials, including wool, polyester, jute, cotton, and more. \nWe first evaluated quality by thoroughly inspecting each rug, checking for any imperfections, such as loose fibers and curling along the edges and corners. \nWe also compared the texture and comfort of each area rug, asking testers to describe how the fibers felt underfoot. Additionally, we noted the thickness and density of the pile as well as the softness of the material. \nA good rug is also one you’d be proud to display—we favored options with unique designs, chic hues, and interesting textures. That said, we understand style is subjective, so we tried to curate a diverse array of options that cater to a variety of decor styles.\nWe’ve tested both washable and non-washable rugs and determined how easy each was to vacuum, spot-clean, and wash (if applicable). To evaluate durability and fiber strength, we physically tested the fibers by abrading them, mimicking the sensation of cat claws.\nIn our homes, we put each area rug up against spills, foot traffic, kids and pets, and daily wear and tear to judge their durability. Our favorite area rugs are soft and comfortable underfoot, easy to clean, and hold up to daily use in high-traffic rooms. \nAdditionally, our findings showed that while we love wool for its quality, softness, and durability, washable options made from synthetic fibers were easier to care for, though they do show signs of wear more easily.\nHow to Shop for an Area Rug\nPick a Durable, Comfortable Fiber\nThe type of fibers used to make an area rug will have a big impact on the durability, softness, and stain resistance of the rug. \nMany of the options on this list are poly blend rugs, which are a great option for easy care and stain resistance. Performance and washable area rugs are made from synthetic materials including polypropylene, nylon, and polyester. \nIf you’re looking for a washable option, we love the Ruggable Gradasi Rug. Another performance option that’s easy to clean (but not washable) is the Rifle Paper Co. Provence Joliette Power-Loomed Rug, which held up to foot traffic, stains, pet claws, and debris like a champ.\nIf you prefer a more classic rug, like a woven wool rug or one made from jute or seagrass fibers, there are plenty of options to suit your style. Our testing has found these rugs to be a bit more delicate when it comes to staining, but their comfort underfoot is a standout feature. \nWool options are the strongest out of the natural area rugs we’ve tried, with fibers that can hold up to frequent foot traffic. The Bungalow Rose Samaniego Hand Tufted Oriental Rug and Rugs USA Diamond Trellis Nursery Rug are two great wool options that were standouts in our testing.\nThe Pottery Barn Chunky Knit Sweater Rug is another impressively durable option made from wool, viscose, and cotton. It’s quite thick and durable, and we’re impressed with how well it fared when testing for outdoor use.\nExpert Tip\nWhen shopping for an area rug, think about the type of foot traffic your rug will get. You’ll want to place durable rugs in your high-traffic areas like mudrooms, hallways, and kids’ playrooms. Anything decorative or delicate is better off in the bedroom or other low-traffic areas. If you have pets or kids, the fiber strength and stain resistance of your area rug will be increasingly important, too.\nSelect a Pile Height That Suits Your Needs\nThe pile height refers to how long the carpet fibers are. Typically, pile height for an area rug is described as low, medium, or high—though you’ll sometimes see it expressed in inches. \nArea rugs with a low pile or no pile typically offer easier maintenance, since it’s harder for dirt, debris, and pet hair to hide among fibers. The rug with the lowest pile on this list is the Ruggable Gradasi Rug, which has a pile of just 2 millimeters (or 0.08 inches). Low-pile rugs also shed less and can hold their own with heavy foot traffic.\nOn the other hand, a medium- or high-pile area rug will give you a cushier, more luxurious feeling. The Ashler Home Faux Sheepskin Rug has the highest pile on this list at 2.8 inches, and while not suitable for high-traffic areas, we think it’s an exceptionally plush and comfortable option. \nHigh-pile options are great for areas where you want to relax but will show dirt more easily than low-pile area rugs. Additionally, note that high-pile rugs can be indented with heavy furniture.\nChoose the Best Size and Shape for Your Room Layout\nOne of the most important details to consider when shopping for an area rug is the size. If you go too small, the rug will seem out of proportion with the room and won’t suit its purpose. However, a rug that is too large can overwhelm the space—or might not fit at all. \nChoosing the right-sized area rug for your home will depend on your preference and where you'd like it to go. As a good rule of thumb, your rug should be at least six inches, but no more than two feet away from a room's walls. \nTypical living room-sized area rugs are 8 x 10 and 10 x 12 feet. Smaller rooms may prefer 5 x 3 and 6 x 9-foot rugs, which are also common sizes. You'll also want to leave around 30 to 36 inches of space between the rug and any large pieces of furniture in your space. \nOne way to know whether your rug is too small for your space is to look at the furniture in the room. At least one leg or corner of each piece of furniture in the room should sit on the area rug. There are exceptions to the rule though, like conversation sets in corners and open-concept spaces.\nIf standard-sized rugs just won’t do for your space, the Revival Dawn Ombre Rug comes in custom sizes. \nAdditionally, remember that area rugs aren’t always rectangular. Oval, round, and square area rugs can make a nice addition to your room as well.\nThe Jonathan Y Moroccan Hype Boho Rug offers 35 sizes and a range of shapes, including rectangle, square, oval, round, and runner.\nThe Spruce / Joline Buscemi\nHow to Clean Your Area Rug\nTo start, area rugs should be vacuumed at least once a week. That will make it easier to clean your rug when it comes time because there will be less dirt and grime buried deep within the rug fibers. You can also use a carpet rake to pull up debris and pet hair and keep your area rug in tip-top shape.\nIf your area rug is stained, you'll want to spot-clean it immediately. We recommend checking out our favorite carpet stain removers, which we found to be highly effective. You can also try using a solution of one teaspoon of dishwashing liquid with two cups of warm water. \nAn area rug should be deep-cleaned with a carpet cleaner at least twice a year and more often if it's in an area with heavy foot traffic.\nWhen cleaning the entire rug, you can use carpet shampoo on most area rugs, but you'll want to check and see whether you need to dilute it first before using it. You can apply the shampoo to your rug with a sponge mop or soft-bristled brush and then rinse it thoroughly.\nWe also recommend rotating your area every so often to even out the wear and hide the edges, since that's where you'll see the wear most obviously.\nThe Spruce / Henry Wortock\nOne More Thing\nEvery rug needs a grippy rug pad underneath. We love cushioned rug pads that go edge to edge under a rug, which prevent movement and add some comfort underfoot. Pretty much every type of rug is going to be prone to movement, and rug pads can help prevent tripping hazards and sliding.\nWhy Trust The Spruce?\nHeather Adams is a senior editor with The Spruce who’s put plenty of rugs through their paces in her own home. Over her years of trying rugs of every fiber makeup, she’s tested everything from 100 percent wool rugs from brands like Crate & Barrel and Pottery Barn to washable area rugs from Ruggable to cotton-blend nursery rugs in her son’s room. In writing this article, Adams used her own firsthand experience using, cleaning, and putting daily wear on rugs of all different types along with testing insights from The Spruce team collected over the course of months and years."

  "articleText": "HOME DESIGN & DECORATING DECORATING HOME ACCESSORIES\n10 Area Rug Placement Dos and Don’ts\nRug Placement Tips for Living Rooms, Bedrooms, and More\nBy PATRICIA SHANNON\nand LAUREN FLANAGAN\nUpdated on 12/13/24\nFact checked by MARCUS REEVES\nIN THIS ARTICLE\nDo Go Under Furniture\nDo Go Big\nDo Cover High-Traffic Areas\nDon't Go Too Small\nDo Leave Equal Space\nDo Consider Maintenance\nDo Invest in Quality\nDo Consider Rug Pads\nFAQ\nBACK TO TOP\nWhen it comes to area rugs throughout your home, consider their placement and size. Area rugs are a terrific alternative to wall-to-wall carpets because they're easier to remove and clean. However, finding the right rug placement is determined by the furniture, room size, and the rug's style, type, and material.\nThere are some important rules to remember when using area rugs in your home, whether you place them in a bedroom, living room, dining room, or den. Below, we have detailed everything you need to know about area rug placement dos and don'ts.\nWhat Is an Area Rug?\nAn area rug is an accent rug that does not extend to the walls. It is mostly used to anchor furniture in a space.\nThe Spruce / Mira Norian\nDo Extend Rugs Under Furniture\nLeaf and Lo\nWhen selecting an area rug, ensure it extends under all the key pieces of furniture in the room.\nLiving Room Rug Placement\nChoose a large enough carpet for the living room to ensure the furniture's front legs stay on the rug. Or, keep just the front legs of any major upholstered pieces on the rug. Try leaving at least 3 inches of carpet in front of the legs to anchor the furniture. The back legs can stay off the rug as long as the front legs stay on. Try keeping all the legs of smaller pieces of furniture on the living room area rug.\nBedroom Rug Placement\nIn a bedroom, push the area rug against the wall at the head of the bed, with 18 inches on all sides for nightstands and clearance at the end of the bed. A properly placed bedroom area rug anchors the bed and the surrounding furnishings.\nDining Room Rug Placement\nA dining room rug should be large enough to hold the chairs and table. Ideally, chair legs should be on the dining room area rug, even when pulled out from the table. In a typical dining room, this means extending the rug 3 feet beyond the edge of the dining table.\nCOMMON PITFALLS\nConsider the shape of your area rug as well as the size. For example, placing a large round area rug under a rectangular dining table could result in chair legs sitting on the bare floor, creating instability, imbalance, and an overall visually awkward room.\nDo Go Big If You Want Your Living Room to Feel Larger\nIt might sound counterintuitive, but a bigger area rug will make your living room seem larger. If you have a rug under a sectional, the entire couch should fit on the carpet, creating an expansive (and cohesive) anchor in the room. Leave approximately 6 feet of floor space around the perimeter of the rug.\nIn most rooms, you will choose a standard area rug size. The most common area rug sizes include:\n5x7 feet \n7x9 feet \n9x10 feet \n8x12 feet \n9x12 feet \n12x18 feet\nDo Cover High-Traffic Areas\nBrophy Interiors\nFully cover the floors of pass-through rooms. Large area rugs here help protect floors from wear and tear, scratches, and prematurely refinishing projects.\nHOW TO MAINTAIN\nIf you're putting an area rug in a high-traffic area, don't stress! Area rugs are easier to maintain than wall-to-wall carpets. You can keep area rugs clean by spot cleaning with a small appliance or you can purchase a washable rug and toss it in the machine.\nDon't Go Too Small in the Bedroom\nA soft area rug adds a comfortable landing space each time you step out of bed, so it is important to go bigger than you might expect in the bedroom. The bedroom rug should be considerably larger than the size of the bed and it should fit under the nightstands to help anchor the look with a cozy texture. Be sure to get your measurements right before you go shopping.\nBedroom Rug Size Tips\nYou can go bigger but these numbers should be the minimums you want to look for.\nTwin/double bed: The rug should be large enough to extend beyond the sides of the bed by at least 12 inches.\nQueen/king bed: Opt for a rug that, at minimum, extends 18 inches beyond the sides of the bed.\nDo Leave Equal Space\nHome By Polly\nLeave the same amount of floor space on all sides of your rug in all your rooms. For example, the sofa should be centered on the rug. Give yourself anywhere from 8 to 24 inches of clearance on all sides. Eighteen inches is the most common parameter but as little as 8 inches is okay in a smaller space.\nIf you have a tricky furniture layout, make sure the front legs of both sides of a sectional, for example, land on the rug.\nTips\nAlways remember that the main goal is to have the rug centered in the room.\nDon't Place Your Best Rugs in Danger\nDon't place your most expensive rug under the dining table. Put your best rug in a space where it's highlighted as a focal point. However, consider a spot where the rug will be protected from spills, stains, and extreme wear and tear.\nArea rugs are easier to clean than broadloom carpeting. However, removing stains on area rugs can still be challenging if you have a household with children and pets. Go with inexpensive, easy-to-clean options in areas where staining could be commonplace.\nDon't Let the Investment Scare You  \nThe number one mistake made when decorating with area rugs is getting one that is too small. This is understandable, especially when comparing price tags on a 5'x8' versus a 10'x14' area rug. However, investing in the right size saves you from the need to replace an area rug that does not fit. A typical 8'x10' rug could cost $200 at a place like Ikea, but you may pay over $1,000 for a high-end, longer-lasting one.\nDo Consider What Kind of Rug Pad You Need\nFinding the right pad for your area rug can help it stay in place, give some added cushion in areas where needed (for example, in bedrooms), or even protect the flooring (especially when layering sisal over hardwoods). Determine your needs and plan your rug pad appropriately. It is helpful to buy a slightly larger rug pad than your area rug and trim it down to size with scissors for the perfect fit.\nBest Area Rugs Roundups\n16 Area Rugs We Love For Every Type of Decor\nAfter Testing Washable Rugs, Here Are the Best We Recommend\nThe 12 Best Wool Rugs of 2024\n1 of 2\nFAQ\nCan a rug be too big for a room?\nIf there is less than 6 inches of floor space around the rug or every piece of furniture is entirely on the carpet, it may be too big for the space. An oversized rug can overwhelm your space and make it feel less styled.\nHow far should a rug go under a couch?\nA couch's front and back legs can go entirely on the rug. However, if only the front legs are on the carpet, ensure at least 3 inches of rug shows behind the legs under the sofa.\nDo you center a rug with the room or the couch?\nIdeally, the rug is centered with both the room and the couch. If that is not possible, center the rug with the sofa for a more intentional look.\nHow far from a TV or media center should a living room rug be placed?\nA living room rug should be placed no more than 3 inches from a TV console or media center. For a cozier look and to pull it within the seating area, put the front legs of the media console on the area rug, with 3 inches of excess behind the legs."

  "articleText": "HOME DESIGN & DECORATING ROOM DESIGN LIVING ROOMS\nHow to Choose the Right Area Rug\nBy LAUREN FLANAGAN\nUpdated on 04/15/22\nThe Spruce / Michelle Becker\nIN THIS ARTICLE\nBefore You Buy\nConsiderations\nTypes\nCost\nHow to Choose\nWhere to Shop\nBACK TO TOP\nArea rugs can be powerful design tools, whether they act as artwork for the floor or simply provide a complementary background for the other decor. Imagine taking a room with a dark red Turkish rug and switching it out for a plain sisal version, or exchanging a Moroccan tile print for a French Aubusson. With just this one simple switch, a room can go from traditional to modern, classic to contemporary, or bland to bold. Deciding which area rug is right for you involves several key considerations. Here we provide you with some to keep in mind when buying a new area rug for your room, including styles, types, patterns, sizes, and care.\nBefore Buying a New Area Rug\nRugs put up with a lot from us in our homes they get walked on, played on, wiped on, spilled on, yet provide us with padding and comfort for our feet, and change the look and feel of the entire room. They deal with a lot of wear and tear from our family, including children, pets, and visitors. A rug that is starting to look worn and tired, is stained, and in some cases starting to emit an odor is indicative of a rug that is past its time and should be replaced. Or, you might also be wanting to freshen up the room with a new look.\nIf your area rug is showing any of these signs, or you're looking for a change, then you'll want to start browsing around for a new one.\nBuying Considerations for an Area Rug\nRug Styles\nThere are as many area rug styles as there are furniture styles, lighting styles, or room styles, meaning there's an almost unending variety of options. Rooms are no longer limited to traditional Persian rugs or classic European styles. Alongside these time-honored options are modern and contemporary alternatives, such as bold florals, strong geometrics, and simple jutes and sisals.\nBefore settling on a style, educate yourself about what is available and think about what kind of atmosphere you want to create in your room. Remember that an area rug doesn't need to match everything in a room, but it should work with the textures and tones of the existing furnishings.\nColor\nColor is a natural starting point when choosing an area rug. Obviously, you need to think about what colors you like and what colors you'd like to live with day in and day out, but that's not all. The color of your area rug will set the tone for the entire room, so it's an important decision.\nIf you already have furniture, consider how different colors will work with your existing items. Rooms with a lot of color and pattern often work best with a rug that has neutral tones or a single color. If you don't already have furnishings, consider how different rug colors will work with the tones of the flooring, walls, and ceiling. Rugs can either stand out or blend in, so think about what effect you want to create when considering color.\nRug Patterns\nNot everyone is enthusiastic about patterns, but if your furniture and walls are all solid colors, a patterned rug can really bring your room to life. Likewise, if you have patterned furniture, a solid rug can have a grounding, calming effect. It's all about balance; if your room is already furnished, take this into account before choosing a rug. If the rug is one of the first items you're purchasing, though, think about what pattern is right for you. Do you want something eye-catching or a little more subtle? The effect a pattern has on a room is closely tied to its colors, so consider how the two will work together.\nArea Rug Sizes\nA rug that's too small for the room is one of the most common decorating mistakes. For most average-sized rooms, there should be about 10 to 20 inches of bare floor between the edges of the rug and the walls of the room. Depending on the size of the room, you can go as low as eight inches and as high as 24 inches. In any case, make sure the rug is centered in the room and the distance between the rug and the wall is the same on all four sides.\nYou can also use rugs to define spaces. If you have an open-concept space or you want to layer rugs, the rules can be a little different. Think about the area you want to highlight and choose a size based on that, but remember that it's better to go too big than too small.\nTypes\nHigh Pile vs. Low Pile\nWhen choosing a rug, it's important to think about what kind of pile you want: low, medium, or high. Low-pile rugs are generally sturdier than high-pile rugs and are easier to vacuum and keep clean. They're also less expensive than high-pile rugs. Rugs with a longer pile are softer and more luxurious underfoot and can help make rooms look cozier and more inviting. As a general rule, a room that gets a lot of foot traffic will benefit from a low-pile rug, such as a dhurrie or kilim rug, while a thicker rug will last longer in a room that doesn't get a lot of traffic.\nMaterials\nThe material that a rug is made of comes into play, whether it be a natural fiber rug or a synthetic rug.\nNatural fiber includes such materials as wool, silk, cotton, jute, or bamboo. Wool rugs tend to be higher quality and more expensive, but hold up well in high-traffic areas, yet have a tendency to shed at least for the first few months. Rugs made out of cotton are less expensive, are a good option for casual spots, yet fade quickly, and are not stain-repellant.\nSynthetic rugs are popular choices on the market and include polypropylene, nylon, polyester, and microfiber. These rugs are typically fade-resistant, easy to clean, and very budget-friendly. They are less expensive making it easier to exchange them out for a new one, and a good alternative for families and pet owners.\nCost\nThe cost of an area rug is all dependent on a number of factors: from the size you need, the materials used, how the rug is constructed, to the overall quality. If the rug is handwoven, imported, has patterns or dyes, is machine-made or hand-knotted, made with man-made or natural fibers, these all affect the price of a rug, too.\nThat being said, to give you some kind of idea of the price, a quality 8x10 size area rug can run anywhere from $300 up to as high as $10,000 to purchase. A 5x7 rug can run anywhere from as little as $35 and go up to $1,000 or more.\nThe quality and amount of work that has gone into manufacturing the rug drive the cost up higher. Keep an eye out for sales around holidays, like Memorial Day, Labor Day, or the end of the year, which are always good times to look. Figure out what you can afford to spend on a new area rug before you start shopping.\nHow to Choose a New Area Rug\nLifestyle\nYour lifestyle should be a big determining factor in what rug you ultimately choose. If you have children or pets, a white rug with a high pile is probably not the best choice. If you expect that your rug will have to deal with a lot of wear and tear, a flat weave rug with a pattern that masks stains is worth considering, as it will be easier to maintain and keep clean. On the other hand, if you want to create a sense of comfort and luxury, a flat weave rug probably won't do the trick. Instead, you'll want something softer with a higher pile. Just be aware that it will not stand up to damage as well as something with a lower pile.\nMaintenance \nWhen choosing a rug, be honest with yourself about how much work you are willing to put into maintaining it. Most rugs need to be vacuumed and rotated regularly. Flat-weave rugs are easy to vacuum, but you can also take them outside and beat them out the old-fashioned way. High-pile rugs are more difficult to clean, and some must be either sent out or professionally cleaned in the home.\nNo matter what type you choose, be sure to use a rug pad that is compatible with the rug material and the flooring below. Don't expose a rug to direct sunlight if you can avoid it, and definitely do not let stains set. If you do any of these things, you may actually ruin your area rug, no matter what type you choose.\nWhere to Shop\nArea rugs can be found in many places, from the supercenters, carpet stores, home improvement centers, department stores, and online. When buying a rug, it is a personal preference how you purchase it, but it is nice to have the chance to run your fingers through the rug's pile to see how it feels and see how it's constructed.\nTouching different types of rugs can help you understand the difference in how they're made and what the materials feel like, which can help in your selection process of an area rug that's the perfect fit for you and your family. You can always check out area rugs in the store and then look online to see if the same one is available and compare the price point.\nTake your time when looking, peruse all the many options to choose from, as an area rug will be a focal point in your room for a few years.\nFAQ\nHow often should you clean a rug?\nYour rug should be vacuumed one to two times a week and deep cleaned at least twice a year. If you have kids and pets, you should consider cleaning it four times a year.\nHow long do area rugs last?\nThe average lifespan of an area rug is approximately 3 to 10 years. This, of course, also depends on the quality, care, and use of the rug.\nDo you need to put anything under an area rug?\nYou should always put a pad underneath an area rug. This helps to protect the floor, keep the rug from slipping, provides more padding, and extends the life of the rug.\nWhat time of year is best time to buy an area rug?\nAlmost any time of year, there seem to be sales on rugs. Fall and winter are when stores are bringing in new styles. January and early spring, the late spring months, and during holidays are popular times for sales on rugs, too.\n16 Area Rugs We Love For Every Type of Decor"

  "articleText": "If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation.\nHOME NEWS BRANDS & COLLECTIONS\nAttention, Plant Lovers: This Is the One Section You Should Be Shopping at IKEA\nBy SOPHIA BEAMS\nPublished on 10/24/23\nThe Spruce / Photo Illustration by Amy Sheehan / IKEA\nWhen you’re thinking about the immensely popular Swedish furniture store IKEA, its plant selection probably isn’t the first thing that comes to mind—if you even know it exists at all. But if you’re an indoor plant enthusiast who loves a bargain, you need to add IKEA to your plant store roster. \nThe home furnishings chain has a lot to offer in its underestimated nursery section. Not only are the prices low (often running an average of $10 cheaper than other major nursery chains), but the plants are incredibly healthy, rivaling the beauty of more expensive gardening stores. They're even sourced locally, hence why they're so affordable.\nTo navigate this section like a seasoned plant pro, check out our top tips.\nCheck the Stock Online Before You Go\nYou can browse the full selection of available IKEA plants online. The website typically features a variety of the most popular plants that are available across the widest variety of stores, such as gorgeous ficus plants to an Arabic coffee plant in a coffee mug.\nAlthough IKEA won’t ship their plants, you can easily see which plants are being sold at stores near you by setting your preferred store in the app or online, giving you the fastest way to browse their nurseries from the comfort of your own home and find out what's actually available. Where else are you going to find a healthy 10-inch monstera deliciosa for just $23?\nIKEA\nLook for the Weekly Restock\nIKEA stores restock plants every week (and sometimes even biweekly), but there’s no single restocking day across all stores. Each store in your area may have a different day they get new plants in from their local suppliers. If you’ve got a particular plant you’re looking out for, checking the availability online is the best way to keep your eye on it. Otherwise, just give your store of choice a call to find out what days their plant options will refresh.\nIKEA\nShop the Quarterly Restock\nAs for the seasonal selections, IKEA gives their plant inventory a complete restyling four times a year with the changing of the seasons. Around the months of February, April, August, and October, the retailer will offer up its seasonal greenery; the first few days of this restock are by far the best times year-round to find the most unique indoor plants available.\nJust like the weekly restocks, the specific dates for these quarterly selections will vary by store; call in to figure out the big day ahead of time.\nKeep an Eye on the App for Restocks\nThe website and IKEA app will also note the plant product changes every day. Restocked plants always sell out quickly, so make sure you're staying on top of the restocking days if you want the best deals, or you can choose to be alerted when it comes back in stock.\nCheck for Pests Before You Buy\nAn unhealthy plant is one thing, but just one bug-infested plant could infect your other ones. IKEA inspects their plants for pests, but it's better to be safe than sorry.\nTo check for bugs, look at your plant with a flashlight (the one on your phone will do if you’re trying to be inconspicuous). You should be looking for small webs around the base of your plant (indicating spider mites), insects underneath leaves or along the stems of the plant, and any critters that are hiding in the first layer of dirt. Most pests will gather underneath plant leaves, so be sure to inspect each leaf carefully.\nLook for Plants With New Growth\nGenerally, you’ll want to make sure that your plant has healthy leaves, several supporting stems, and new growth. New growth near the base or from the stems of a plant is a great sign—it means the plant is healthy enough to be pushing out new stems, leaves, or blooms. \nTip\nIf a plant is wilting or very top-heavy (with lots of leaves on the top and hardly any leaves or stems on the bottom), it may still be salvageable, but isn’t in the best condition.\nTry Out Planters and Watering Cans\nTreat the planter section like a fitting room and test out different pots on your plant (same goes for a watering can to see what spout length and size would be best). If you want to leave the plant in its plastic container, check out the pots without drainage holes and see if you like one. If you want to replant, look to the ones with drainage holes in the bottom.\nIf the roots are poking out the bottom of the pot or the top of the soil, it's a sign you need to repot. In that case, choose a planter that is an inch or so bigger in diameter than the current pot.\nGrab a Grow Light\nIKEA also features a number of lightbulbs specifically designed to help your plants grow (aka, growlights). If your home isn’t getting enough light and your current plants are suffering, just grab an IKEA LED cultivating bulb to install in a floor or table lamp.\nTest Plant Stand Weight Capacity\nGrab your plant (or a plant, if you aren't planning on buying one) and set it on the plant shelf you're thinking of buying to make sure it can hold the weight of however many plants you’re planning to put on its shelves (and their pots, too).\nA good plant shelf will be asymmetrically stacked or even slanted so that all of the plants on its shelves receive equal amounts of light. Some will even come with handy trellises or handles for vines to grow onto.\nOnly Buy If You're Sure\nExamine your plant of choice from IKEA carefully before purchasing, as the retailer doesn’t accept returns on plants once you’ve bought them."

Whether you choose to build a DIY porch railing or hire a professional, be sure to use quality materials that will hold up over time.\nWhat are the different types of railing for a porch?\nPorch railings are made from materials such as PVC, vinyl, powder-coated aluminum, stainless steel, stained or painted wood, or wrought iron. Some newer homes incorporate tempered glass panes for a more contemporary look. If you live in an older or period home, consider the architecture when replacing, refurbishing, or choosing a porch railing, since updating a Craftsman or Victorian porch with a non-traditional style can wreck your home’s curb appeal and dishonor its history.\nHow do I choose a porch railing?\nYour choice of porch railing will be determined by a number of factors, from your budget to local building safety codes to the size and height of your porch. When choosing a porch railing, select materials, colors, and styles that will complement the architecture of your home. Look around the neighborhood to see what kinds of porch railings feature on homes similar to yours and determine which ones speak to you. Consider the climate where you live since different materials and finishes will be more or less durable in warm, cold, or humid climates."

  "articleTitle": "Area Rug Rules of Thumb to Follow",
  "articleText": "HOME DESIGN & DECORATING DECORATING HOME ACCESSORIES\nArea Rug Rules of Thumb to Follow\nWidth and placement are the first priorities\nBy LAUREN FLANAGAN\nUpdated on 06/30/22\nAdobe / Getty Images\nThere are plenty of reasons why it’s ideal to have an area rug in a living room, bedroom, or other living space. Area rugs provide comfort, warmth, and decorative interest (color, pattern, texture, etc.). And they can create a frame in which to place furniture and define spaces.\nArea rugs are often advantageous over wall-to-wall carpeting because they are easier to clean. And if you get tired of the look, it’s easier to switch out an area rug and replace it with something new. While there are tons of options, there are certain rug rules to consider before buying an area rug.\nSize\nKeep the following tips in mind regarding area rug size:\nThe most frequent mistake people make with area rugs is to get one that is too small. An area rug should fit under all of the key furniture pieces in a room. So think about your furniture arrangement before committing to a rug. For instance, a rug should go far enough under a couch that at least the couch's front legs—and preferably its back legs too—can be on the rug. The rug also should be at least 6 inches wider than the couch. For smaller furniture, the entire piece should be able to fit on the rug.\nIf you have a particularly large room, divide it into zones and use a different rug for each one. The rugs don’t have to match, but they should be tied together by color or pattern.\nFor most average-size rooms, a rug should cover all but approximately 1 to 2 feet of bare floor between its edges and the walls. So that would mean at least a 10-foot square rug size for a 12x12 foot room. Make sure the rug is centered in the room and the distance between the rug and the wall is the same on all four sides.\nNo matter what the size, make sure that in heavily trafficked areas there is enough room for people to walk on the rug. They shouldn’t have one foot on and one foot off.\nColor and Pattern\nDon’t be afraid to choose a rug with color and pattern, but remember these tips:\nArea rugs are like artwork for the floor, and they’re a great way to infuse some playfulness into a room. But at the same time, consider furniture placement if the rug pattern isn't uniform. You don't want the part of the rug with the design to be covered up.\nIf your room is an unusual size or you want to customize a pattern, consider carpet tiles. Carpet tiles come in a variety of colors and patterns, so you can choose what works for you. It’s also possible to switch out tiles if there’s a spill.\nMaintenance\nCleaning guidelines for rugs vary, but there are certain things you can do to maintain your rug to help it look its best and last for years to come. Before buying, think about where you’ll be using it and what kind of maintenance will be required:\nGenerally speaking, medium- to high-pile rugs should be thoroughly cleaned once a year to remove dust, hair, and allergens. Vacuuming isn’t enough. You'll either have to send the rug out or invest in a carpet cleaner, taking the rug's individual cleaning guidelines into account.\nLow-pile and flatweave rugs should be taken outside periodically to be shaken out.\nRugs made of natural fibers, such as jute and sisal, generally can't be washed, so big spills might result in permanent damage. That said, they don’t show minor dirt and stains as much as other fibers.\nKeep the rug tags with cleaning instructions, so you don't forget any specific cleaning do's and don'ts."

  "articleText": "HOME NEWS BRANDS & COLLECTIONS\nEkua Ceramics Transforms Essentials Like Basic Chairs Into Sculptural Wonders\nBy MARISA SUZANNE MARTIN\nUpdated on 09/18/24\n The Spruce / Illustration by Amy Sheehan / Ekua Ceramics\nHome Away From Home is a series that spotlights BIPOC brands that are adding a cultural essence to everyday items. This allows anyone to always have a piece of their culture in their own space without ever feeling homesick or out of touch with their roots. We're exploring the stories of the individuals behind the brands that have touched people's hearts through their products and have allowed people to feel at home anywhere.\nWhen Sara Ekua Todd, the founder of Ekua Ceramics, tagged along with a friend to a two hour introductory ceramics class, she had no idea it would change her life, kickstarting a passion that would eventually turn into a full-fledged career.  \nYet that’s exactly what happened, and nearly a decade later, Todd is helming Ekua Ceramics, a buzzy stoneware brand that’s known for its alluring shapes and zestful use of color. \nInspired by her multi-ethnic, Belgium-based upbringing—in what she describes as a loud and colorful home—Todd is bringing joy to kitchen cabinets, counters, and patios everywhere with her lively mugs, bowls, and planters that take an artful approach to everyday living. \nEkua Ceramics\nThe Story of Shaping Her Craft\nTodd explains how she grew up in a free and creative household and was always encouraged to follow her dreams. For Todd, these dreams led her from her native Belgium to Long Beach, California where she took that now-fated ceramic class.\nAlthough she took to clay immediately, she admits finding her groove and personal style required time. It wasn’t until two years later, in 2017, that she released her first official ceramics collection.\nWhen it came time to name her brand, Todd didn’t have to look far, opting for her Ghanaian middle name “Ekua\" which is a name you give to a girl when she's born on a Wednesday, Todd explains.\nEkua Ceramics\nAfter her first pieces launched, Todd ran a series of pop-up shops, generating a word-of-mouth buzz, and was invited to team up with a well-known street fashion designer to create a line of branded dishware.\nFeeling more confident in her skills, Todd began to reach out to brands with her solo work. One of her earliest successes was the “Circle Mug,” a three-tier mug with a stacked circle appearance that evokes the chunkier, organic “wabi-sabi” style.\nEven in a crowded ceramics marketplace, Todd’s pieces won over buyers with their unique, sculptural shapes—Todd explains how she was encouraged to take by her family's upbringing which emphasized individuality.\n“I've heard people say my handles are uncomfortable, or they don’t like the feeling of raw clay, but I’ve never heard anyone say my mugs are basic,” she says. \nEkua Ceramics\nWant more design inspiration? Sign up for our free daily newsletter for the latest decor ideas, designer tips, and more!\nPutting the “Play” in Clay \nSince the get-go, Todd has been guided by the desire to make clay appear against its nature.\n“Clay in itself is a hard medium and it’s pretty heavy, so I like the play on it looking like the opposite,” she says. Her efforts pay off, resulting in ceramic pieces that appear to defy gravity.\nFor instance, her “Tissue Box Cover” looks more like a tissue than a hard-edged box. Rather than appearing weighty, it's light and airy-looking, like fabric suspended mid-air. \nEkua Cermics\nGiven how sculptural her work is, it’s a surprise to hear that Todd doesn’t consider herself the best artist.\n“I’m really bad at drawing,” she admits. “When I have an idea that appears in my head I either try to sketch it or just write down words to describe it.”\nToday, Todd counts Southern California among her biggest muses, citing the city’s melting pot of culture, color, food, and proximity to the water as inspiration. \n“I love to just walk around the museums and look at paintings,” she says, noting that Ettore Sottsass, Gaetano Pesce, Enzo Mari, and Le Corbusier are among her favorites. \"I'm inspired by colors and love seeing how other artists use them.\"\nEkua Ceramics\nLiving in Full Color \nTodd’s passion for color is on full display in her work. Hop on her site you see she favors deep, saturated hues in shades like “Cloud,\" which is a powdery sky blue. Todd often spends a lot of time doing color research and says it's one of her favorite parts when she starts a new collection.\nOn average, Todd only adds one to two new colors per season. This season’s newcomer is a super-saturated royal purple hue known as “Amethyst.\"\nShe’s also been known to phase out colors—pink and gray are colors she worked with early on that you won’t see in heavy rotation anymore—encouraging admirers to scoop up anything that catches their eye while it’s in stock. \nMaking colored clay is an intensive process that involves mixing stains into the clay and loading it into a pug mill, which dispenses the clay in a thick, pasta-like tube. \nTo make her beautifully-colored clay more accessible to amateur ceramists, Todd recently began selling raw clay in signature Ekua shades on her site. \nPhoto by Bre Furlong\nGiving Back \nThese days, Todd is focused on sharing the joy of making ceramics with others. She recently debuted a series of local workshops she teaches in Long Beach, which is called clay play.\nClass-goers can choose from offerings like making a mug or an intro to Nerikomi, which is a decorative ceramic craft from Japan that involves stacking colored clay, and then slicing through the cross section to reveal a pattern. \n“I love that each student comes in really excited to learn and make something special that they can take home, and they don’t need to have any ceramic experience,” Todd says.\nAs for progressing her craft, Todd is beginning to dabble in ceramic furniture. She recently polished off a table that now lives at the Yowie Hotel in Philadelphia. Lighting and large-scale planters are also in the works. \nFor Todd, the evolution of her brand is something she marvels at frequently.\n“One day you’re taking your first ceramic class, and then one day a bunch of strangers are drinking out of your mugs,” she says. \"It's incredible.\""

  "articleText": "HOME NEWS HOME TRENDS\n7 Tips to Score Big at Summer Antique and Flea Markets\nBy ASHLEY CHALMERS\nPublished on 06/18/23\nThe Spruce / Leticia Almeida\nOf all the things we love most about summer, the return of outdoor markets and antique fairs ranks high on the list. But even people who love the thrill of the flea market chase can admit that it’s often an overwhelming experience. How do you know if you’re buying something at a fair price? What’s a great find versus a total scam? And where can you find all the best markets to shop 'til you drop?\nLuckily, finding a unique, one-of-a-kind item that perfectly enhances your space makes it all worth the effort. So, to answer these questions and more, we turned to the experts. Here’s what they had to say, and their top tips for scoring big at all the outdoor markets this summer.\nMEET THE EXPERT\nJerad Gardemal is the founder of JF Gardemal Designs, an interior design firm in Baton Rouge, LA.\nLaura Sotelo is the co-founder of Olive Ateliers. a secondhand home decor importer and retailer specializing in found objects with lots of character.\nIt’s Not Your Imagination: Summer Is Best for Antiquing\nIf the crowds flooding the outdoor markets make you wonder if you’d be better off returning when the weather cools down, it’s a reasonable question. But Jerad Gardemal of JF Gardemal Designs assures us summer really is the ideal time—and not just because of the weather. Actually, vendors spend all year (and especially early spring) perusing antique markets around the world to prepare for summer.\n“So many vendors from the United States travel to Europe to hunt for treasures to bring back to the U.S.,” Gardemal says. “Therefore, summer tends to be a great time to peruse those treasures.” \nOlive Ateliers\nNever Go Without a Cart and Cash\nAccording to Laura Sotelo, co-founder of Olive Ateliers, there are two things she never, ever visits a market without: a cart and cash. While plenty of market stalls these days are equipped to take cards, it’s not always a sure thing, and Sotelo says being as flexible as possible when shopping is key for maintaining your sanity at a flea market.\nHaving cash on hand gives you this option, and Sotelo suggests always having an assortment of small and large bills with you. Also key? Two free hands. “Carts take the load off so we’re not limited by what we can carry in our two hands,” Sotelo says. \nGardemal agrees with both of Sotelo’s points and suggests preparing ahead of your day. This can include making a list of things you’d love to find and saving ideas on a Pinterest board. \nOlive Ateliers\nLook for a Signature or Maker’s Mark\nIf you’re concerned about the legitimacy of a piece that seems to have great potential, Sotelo says you should always look for some sort of signature or marking from the maker. Then, do a quick search to assess the price, quality, and availability. \n“Don't be afraid to ask the vendor about the product,” Sotelo says. “Many vendors love what they source and are so knowledgeable in product history and quality.” \nYou Can Haggle—Respectfully\nFor some vendors, haggling is expected, and even a bit of a game. Others will shut you down immediately, and the issue is knowing the difference. According to Sotelo, the main key is to always be respectful and flexible. The goal, she notes, isn’t necessarily to get the best deal: it’s to land a fair price for everyone. \nGardemal agrees, noting that this is another reason cash is important to have on hand. “You can sometimes negotiate a lesser price when you offer to pay cash,” he says. \nOlive Ateliers\nConsider These Important Factors\nIf you’re going into this experience hoping to find something for a specific space but don’t know what exactly that might be, that's okay. You can still come prepared. Sotelo even has a small list of important factors to consider:\nSize\nColor\nPricing\nUsability\nRehomability \nSotel suggests also asking yourself two key questions. “Could this live in an alternate part of your space? Could you resell this in the future?” she says. \nOlive Ateliers\nSome Items are Best Left Alone\nWhile it’s of course important to keep an open mind as you browse, Gardemal says there are some things he’s not interested in sourcing from flea markets. These include throw pillows and bed linens.\n“Those are items that I want to know the full history of—I just don’t like the idea of well-loved linens,” says Gardemal.\nThis does, however, exclude other types of linens. “I love a beautiful white linen tablecloth and napkins in pristine condition,” he says.\nBelieve in What’s Meant to Be\nOne of the most overwhelming aspects of flea market hopping is that feeling that you have to make a snap decision, on the spot. While it’s a totally normal thing to stress over, it shouldn’t be a deterrent! Instead, Sotelo suggests doing a gut check. \n“f you absolutely can’t live without it, that’s how you know,” she says. But just because you’re having second thoughts doesn’t mean you should pass, either. Instead, go for a walk and come back.\n“If it’s not there, it’s not meant to be,\" Sotelo says. \"There’s not one thing we didn’t buy that we’re still thinking about.”"

  "articleText": "CLEANING & ORGANIZING CLEANING CLEANING HOW-TOS\nHow to Clean an Area Rug Like the Pros\nBy KATE VAN PELT\nPublished on 06/05/24\nThe Spruce / Jayme Burrows\nIN THIS ARTICLE\nBasic Care\nWool Rugs\nSynthetic Rugs\nJute and Sisal Rugs\nDeep Cleaning\nStains\nFAQ\nBACK TO TOP\nArea rugs can collect dust, pet hair, dirt, mold, and more over time, so this decorative addition requires frequent cleaning. Vacuuming on a weekly basis and shaking out your rug are great methods for removing loose debris. However, the correct steps for deep cleaning your area rug will depend on your rug's material.\nRead on to learn how to clean every type of area rug.\nBasic Care Instructions for Area Rugs\nThe Spruce / Leticia Almeida\nIt's important to deep clean area rugs occasionally to free stuck-on grime, remove odors, and address stains. However, you can keep most area rugs relatively clean in the interim by vacuuming weekly, removing pet hair with a soft-bristle brush, and addressing spills as soon as they occur to prevent stains. Rotating your area rug a couple times a year can also help distribute wear and tear.\nRegular maintenance is especially important in high-traffic areas and will help protect your investment and extend the life of your area rug.\nTip\nFor an extra cleaning boost, flip your rug upside down and vacuum the underside. Depending on the size and weight of your area rug, you might also consider taking it outside to give it a good shake or laying it over a railing and hitting it with a broom to free trapped dust and dirt.\nHow to Clean Wool Rugs\nThe Spruce / Olivia Inman\nWool is the most common type of rug material, and because it's so durable, it's also fairly easy to clean. Once you've vacuumed your wool rug to remove loose dirt and dust, combine a wool-safe rug shampoo in a bucket with cold water (follow the instructions outlined for your specific cleaning solution). Scrub the solution into your rug with a soft-bristle brush, moving in circular motions to lift any trapped debris.\nAfter you've sufficiently cleaned your rug, rinse thoroughly with a garden hose then remove as much moisture as possible with a squeegee or a wet-dry vacuum before leaving it to dry (hang over a railing, if possible). To expedite the drying process, point a fan or two towards the rug, and flip it after several hours.\nHow to Clean Synthetic Rugs\nThe Spruce / Meg MacDonald\nSynthetic area rugs are typically made of materials like nylon or polypropylene and are even more durable than wool rugs. Some synthetic rugs are even suitable for outside.\nTo deep clean your synthetic area rug, you can follow the cleaning method outlined for wool rugs, with just a couple adjustments. Instead of cold water and a rug shampoo, swap the cold water for warm water.\nUse a DIY rug cleaner instead of a store-bought rug shampoo. You can make your own cleaning solution with everyday household products like vinegar and dish detergent.\nHow to Clean Jute and Sisal Rugs\nThe Spruce / Sarah Crowley\nArea rugs made of natural fibers like jute, sisal, and grass can be easily damaged by exposure to moisture. Since these rugs have a relatively open weave, you can often keep them clean with frequent vacuuming or by shaking them outside. However, if you're searching for a deeper cleaning method for your jute rug, consider a dry bath.\nSprinkle a dry rug shampoo or baking powder over the area rug, then allow it to sit and absorb into the fabric for a few hours. Vacuum the rug to finish the dry deep cleaning process.\nHow to Deep Clean an Area Rug\nThe Spruce / Nelly Cuanalo\nTo deep clean a rug, start by laying it on top of a tarp or, if possible, taking it outside to clean. Most area rugs can be cleaned with a scrub brush, a rug cleaner or dish detergent (dependent on the rug's material), and water.\nSynthetic rugs are much more durable than those made of natural fibers, which means you can use warm water and stronger cleaning solutions to deep clean them. Rugs made of wool, however, require cold water to protect them from discoloration and wear.\nRegardless of the material, deep cleaning your area rug annually, along with weekly vacuuming, can help keep your rug in great shape for years.\nTip\nBefore you begin cleaning your area rug, check the underside of your rug for a label. Often these labels will list the appropriate care instructions for your specific rug. Additionally, always test cleaners in an inconspicuous location on your rug before deep cleaning the entire surface.\nHow to Remove Stains From Rugs\nThe Spruce / Ana Cadena\nIf you experience an accidental spill on your area rug, the first step is to address it immediately. Gently blot the spill with a towel to soak up as much of the liquid as you're able. Once you've absorbed the excess liquid, the correct method for tackling any residual liquid will depend on what you spilled.\nTo remove common stains like coffee, wine, tomato-based liquids, and even human waste, combine a quarter teaspoon of white vinegar and one teaspoon of liquid dish detergent with a quart of warm water. Cover the stain with your DIY cleaning solution, rinse thoroughly, then blot to dry. Repeat the process, if needed.\nFAQ\nCan you use carpet cleaner on an area rug?\nExperts suggest you avoid using carpet cleaners for area rugs, as the chemicals can be too harsh for some materials.\nCan I use Dawn dish soap to clean a rug?\nYes, you can use Dawn dish soap to clean your area rug. However, make sure that the water temperature is appropriate for the type of rug you own and always dilute the dish soap in a bucket of water.\nHow do you clean an area rug on a hardwood floor?\nTo avoid damaging your hardwood floors with moisture, you can deep clean your area rug outside, use a dry bath cleaning method, or place a large plastic tarp on the underside of your rug to protect the floor while you clean.\nHow to Clean and Deodorize Carpet With Baking Soda"

  "articleText": "HOME DESIGN & DECORATING DECORATING HOME ACCESSORIES\nHow to Lay an Area Rug Over Carpet\nBy CHERYL SIMMONS\nUpdated on 06/14/24\nThe Spruce / Alyssa Vela\nThere are several reasons why someone may want to lay an area rug on carpet, ranging from wanting to hide a worn or soiled spot in the carpet that otherwise isn’t ready to be replaced, to adding some personal style to a rented space, to simply loving the luxurious look of layering carpet over the carpet.\nWhen laying an area rug over a hard surface such as hardwood flooring, the biggest concern about the rug’s movement is that it will slide around. When laying the rug over carpet, however, the concern is more about the rug wrinkling or rippling, which presents a big tripping hazard. Wrinkling will occur because as one area of the rug is stepped on, it will shift (assuming it is not properly anchored). However, unlike on a smooth surface on which the entire rug would slide, the other end of the rug meets resistance against the carpet underneath, which effectively prevents it from sliding. This means you cause one end to shift without the other end moving, which results in a ripple or “wave” in the area rug.\nHere are some tips to help you properly lay an area rug over carpet.\nAnchor With Furniture\nIf possible, help hold the area rug in place by setting heavy furniture on top of it. If your area rug is for a sitting area, make sure the edges of the rug go under the sofa or chairs, to help keep it from moving. Ideally, there should be furniture holding the rug on all four sides, but if the furniture is heavy enough, simply anchoring it on two opposite sides may be enough.\nThe Spruce / Alyssa Vela\nUse a Non-Slip Pad\nThere is a non-slip rug pad designed for pretty much every use of an area rug, including holding an area rug over broadloom. These are generally referred to as “carpet-to-carpet” pads. These types of pads are specially designed to help keep an area rug from shifting and rippling over the carpet. Additionally, these pads can help prevent damage to the carpet under the rug, as repeated friction from the rug moving over the carpet could cause premature wear or blooming of the carpet fibers underneath.\nThe effectiveness of these carpet-to-carpet pads can vary greatly because there are so many factors (carpet style, rug backing, fiber type, etc.) that the pad can’t necessarily account for, as well as a wide range of pad qualities available. It's best to anchor a rug with furniture, as outlined above. You may still use a non-slip pad underneath, especially if one side of the rug is unable to be anchored. However, for rugs that are nowhere near furniture (in the center of a hallway or foyer, for example) the carpet-to-carpet non-slip pad is your best option for preventing ripples in your area rug.\nUse Double-Sided Tape\nDouble-sided tape can come in handy to keep your rug in place. It's important that you use tape specifically designed for carpet (generally silicone-based). Apply tape on the back of the rug in an X shape from diagonal corner to corner. Place down on the carpet and walk over or use a carpet roller to help stick.\nQuick Tip\nCarpet/rug tape is generally a one-time use, so pulling up can cause it to lose its stickiness and need another application.\n16 Area Rugs We Love For Every Type of Decor"

Rug pads underneath the rug do more than provide cushion and comfort, they help protect your floors and prevent the rug from moving. No matter what type of floor covering your area rug will be laid over, a rug pad is essential for several reasons. Keep reading to see why a rug and rug pad go hand-in-hand, and how to choose which material is best for your space.\nWhat Is a Rug Pad For?\nThink of a rug pad as protection you can't afford to go without. It protects you, your rug, and your floor. Some of its benefits include:\nKeeping your rug from slipping underneath you or curling up, and other significant trip hazards\nExtends your rug's life by minimizing bunching up or edges from unfurling\nSafeguards your floor from needless scratches or indentations from heavy furniture\nAdds another layer of cushion and extra softness with every footfall\nReduces noise\nInsulates room from a cold subfloor\nPrevent Slipping\nRugs can be a tripping hazard, so a rug pad helps to keep the area rug lying flat and in one place. Rug pads vary; some are designed for use over hard surface flooring, while others are best for laying on top of wall-to-wall carpet.\nWARNING\nA good rug pad grips the area rug to prevent it from sliding around. Even rugs anchored by furniture can shift, causing them to buckle, bunch up, and increase falling risk.\nProlong Wear\nLike the cushion under a wall-to-wall carpet, a good rug pad helps protect the area rug from wear and tear by absorbing the majority of the impact from foot traffic. The pad is designed to compress and bounce back (even a firm pad will do this slightly), taking the strain off the rug fibers. Without a pad underneath to act as a shock absorber, the area rug fibers will be crushed, and the rug will show signs of wear much sooner than it would with a proper pad.\nProtect the Floor Underneath\nA rug pad provides a protective barrier between the area rug and the floor underneath. It doesn't matter what type of floor you have underneath your area rug; it still needs protection. Even if you're putting your area rug on top of wall-to-wall broadloom carpet, you still need a rug pad. An area rug's backing can be rough and could cause scratches on hardwood, laminate, and other types of surfaces.\nOther things that could pose a risk to the underlying floor include color transfer from the rug, a small rock or other sharp object being caught underneath the rug, and abrasive wear on the surface of the underlying floor caused by the area rug shifting with foot traffic.\nKeeps the Rug Clean\nNot only does keeping the rug in place benefit the safety of the occupants in your home, but it also prevents dirt and crumbs from getting underneath. Rug pads also allow for better airflow between the pad and rug, which aids in drying the rug should any moisture occur. Certain materials lend to better breathability.\nHow to Choose a Rug Pad\nTo determine the rug pad that would work best for your needs, your area rug's style or pile height should be your guide. Low-profile rugs should have a thin, barely-there pad. Area rugs with shag or heft can accommodate a thicker pad. You don't want to go too thick—you don't want the rug pad to add too much height that it becomes a trip hazard.\nAs you can imagine, many materials are used for rug pad construction, from natural fibers like jute and horsehair to synthetic materials like grippy PVC and memory foam. The lifespan of a rug pad is about three or four years. So, it doesn't make sense to invest in a pricey type since you'll need to replace it in about the same amount of time as a cheaper one.\nFelt is best for its cushioning properties. The best types of rug pads are made of felt, rubber, or a combination of both. A felt-rubber pad is usually a safe bet for hardwood floors.\nRubber has excellent grip properties and grabs the area rug and the floor, keeping the two in place. If you need an indoor rug pad where water splashes often (bathroom, kitchen, or pool area), it's best to go with a rug pad made of all-rubber construction.\nMemory foam is cushiony and a perfect choice for crawling and toddling babies in a nursery. Never use these rug pads outdoors.\nPVC (polyvinyl chloride) rug pads are great choices for the outdoors. PVC is a synthetic, plastic material that can stand up to rain and the elements; however, it off-gasses volatile organic compounds (VOCs), so keep its use outside.\nTip\nAvoid getting a colorful rug pad since it can stain and discolor floors. Also, steer clear of any rugs that use adhesives as glues can harm the floor’s finish.\nHow to Use a Rug Pad\nRug pads come with finished edges, and others are trimmable. If you get a trimmable variety, buy one that is slightly larger than the rug you have so you can customize it perfectly for your room and area rug.\nTest the Area with the Rug and Rug Pad\nIf the rug pad is being used under a doormat or in a bathroom near any swinging doors, it's a dealbreaker if your rug and pad block or bunch up when a door swings open. Before you cut or customize a rug pad, always test the loft of the rug and pad together and make sure it can clear the door opening and closing.\nTrim and Place the Rug Pad\nYou must completely hide the rug pad under your rug. When you're ready to place it down, the rug pad should be about 1 to 2 inches smaller than your rug at all edges, or in the case of rounds or ovals, all around. When trimming the rug pad to your specifications, use a felt-tip marker to make hash marks where to cut, and use sharp, heavy-duty scissors for the cutting.\nCare for The Rug Pad Properly\nWhen a spill occurs on your rug, clean it up as soon as possible. Felt pads may need extra blotting and spot treatment, but rubber memory foam pads are water-resistant and can be wiped clean with a paper towel. \nRoutine cleaning frequency depends on how much foot traffic the rug receives. You can vacuum solid material pads like felt and memory foam rug pads; consider doing it every 1 to 2 years. You can also shake out any non-solid pads. Also, clean the floor beneath the rug and pad at least once a year, as you would usually clean the floor's surface. If rugs are smaller such as door mat and runner sizes, you can vacuum and clean them every few weeks.\nFAQ\nShould a rug pad be the same size as a rug?\nA rug pad should be between 1 to 2 inches smaller than the size of your rug on all sides.\nWhat is the difference between a carpet pad and a rug pad?\nCarpet pads go underneath wall-to-wall carpet, whereas rug pads go underneath rugs that are movable, such as area rugs."

  "articleText": "HOME DESIGN & DECORATING ROOM DESIGN LIVING ROOMS\nChoosing the Right Living Room Area Rug for Your Home\nBy LAUREN FLANAGAN\nUpdated on 03/09/24\nThe Spruce / Sarah Crowley\nIN THIS ARTICLE\nSizes\nShapes\nColors and Patterns\nMaterials and Textures\nLayering\nFAQ\nBACK TO TOP\nAn area rug can bring personality, comfort, and safety into a living room. Choosing the right area rug makes your living room look finished, well-proportioned, and harmonious with your decor. It also allows you to showcase the beauty of hardwood floors, define areas, remove for easy cleaning, and it can be less expensive than broadloom. Learn more about how to choose a rug for the living room and why an area rug may be your best option compared to wall-to-wall carpeting.\nArea Rug Sizes\nWhen the legs of sofas, chairs, and tables are not fully placed on an area rug, the room can look unfinished or unbalanced to the eye. All the legs of your furniture should ideally sit on the area rug. If that's not possible, keep the front legs of your large upholstered pieces on the rug and the back legs off the rug.\nArea rugs come in many standard sizes, including:\n3 by 5 feet\n4 by 6 feet\n5 by 7 feet\n6 by 9 feet\n7 by 9 feet\n8 by 10 feet\n9 by 12 feet\n10 by 14 feet\n12 by 15 feet\nCustom sizes\nWhat Size Area Rug Do I Need?\nYour room's size, shape, and furniture arrangement determine the size of the area rug you need. When buying an area rug to cover most of the living room, avoid choosing one that is too small for the space. There should be a 4- to 12-inch border between the rug and the wall on the sides, and all legs of the major pieces of furniture should ideally rest on the rug.\nThe Spruce / Xiaojie Liu\nShapes\nThough rectangular or square area rugs are typically used in a living room under a seating arrangement, you can also choose round, oval, or octagonal shapes.\nConsider a round, oval, or octagonal-shaped area rug if you want to accent a round or oval coffee table. Round rugs are measured by diameter. To measure for a round rug, find the center of your living room and measure from there to the outside edges of the seating area. Measure that length in feet, double it, and that's the diameter size you should get for your space. If you measure 4 feet from the center of the room to the outside edge of your couch, double that for an 8-foot diameter area rug.\nTip\nHave a carpet store add binding to a remnant piece of broadloom for a custom-sized area rug. This type of custom-size rug can be cost-effective.\nColors and Patterns\nFlooring has a huge impact on the overall look of a living room. Consider the following tips when choosing an area rug:\nChoose a patterned area rug to add color and interest to a room with neutral furniture and walls.\nOpt for a patterned area rug in a darker color to better hide dirt and spills.\nConsider a solid-colored area rug in a neutral color to blend with eclectic decor.\nPull one or two colors from your decor and use them to choose an area rug so you don't have clashing hues creating a visually cluttered space.\nMaterials and Textures\nHow do you want the rug to feel underfoot? How much maintenance are you willing to put into your area rug? For example, beautiful silk or leather area rugs offer a luxurious look and feel but they can be tough to clean. Here are some pros and cons of common area rug materials and textures:\nWool: A natural fiber, a wool area rug adds warmth and softness to the look and feel of a room. Wool can be stain-resistant, and the fiber is durable and resilient (bounces back after compression). A wool area rug can be pricey and needs professional cleaning.\nSisal and jute: Natural materials, such as sisal or jute, are made from durable plant fibers that can be smooth and cool on the feet. (Sisal might be more durable but jute is softer on the feet.) Natural fiber area rugs are often neutral in color though many are dyed with an overlay of pattern. Natural fibers need spot cleaning with minimal water.\nCotton: Many flatweave area rugs are made from cotton, which gives a living room a casual vibe. Cotton area rugs have a lighter feel and texture, making them ideal for summer living, and they can be washed in a machine, depending on the size. Some flatweave area rugs come in smaller sizes and may not cover a large living room space.\nSynthetics (nylon and polyester): Nylon and polyester area rugs have similar characteristics. A nylon area rug is more durable than polyester. But both come in many patterns and colors, they resist fading and staining, and both fibers are easy to clean and maintain.\nViscose: This synthetic fiber, also known as rayon, is manufactured to have the luster, look, and feel of silk or wool. It's affordable but the fiber isn't as durable or stain-resistant as other choices for a living room with heavy foot traffic.\nAcrylic: Faux fur area rugs or synthetic hides are typically made from affordable acrylic fibers. For example, a faux sheepskin area rug is usually a blend of acrylic and polyester. Faux fur rugs need to be hand-washed or spot-cleaned.\nHides: Though pricey, genuine cowhide and sheepskin area rugs can make a statement in a living room. Hides are one of the more durable area rugs you can buy. They resist mold and dust, are long-lasting, and don't usually require much maintenance. Genuine hides are also limited in size.\nMultiple Rugs\nAdd texture or define your space even more by layering area rugs. You can also layer an area rug on top of a wall-to-wall carpet. Use a seasonal area rug as a top layer over your main area rug for an easy swap. For example, layer a large sisal or jute area rug with a thick, fluffy faux fur area rug in the colder months. Switch out the fur rug and add a flatweave area rug over the natural fiber rug to create a lighter, cooler look in warmer months.\nTip\nLayering is often seen in eclectic and boho-style decor to introduce more color and pattern.\nFAQ\nWhat is the general rule about area rugs?\nThe general rule about area rugs is that all of the legs of the furniture should sit on the rug, not off of it.\nHow far should area rugs go under furniture?\nArea rugs should go all the way under furniture. If that is not possible, the carpet should at least go under the front legs of all pieces of furniture with at least a foot of rug extending to the sides of each piece of furniture.\nWhy should I consider an area rug instead of wall-to-wall carpeting?\nAn area rug highlights your hardwood flooring while offering comfort. In addition, it's easier to clean an area rug. Consider an area rug if you have family members in the home prone to falls, just crawling or newly walking, or if you prefer more muffled sounds in your living space. An area rug can also be more cost-effective and versatile than wall-to-wall carpeting in a living room. \n16 Area Rugs We Love For Every Type of Decor"

  "articleText": "HOME DESIGN & DECORATING DECORATING FURNITURE\nTips for Using an Area Rug Over Carpet\nBy SARAH LYON\nUpdated on 11/12/24\nIN THIS ARTICLE\nHow to Choose a Carpet Style\nRug Size\nAnchor the Rug\nFAQ\nBACK TO TOP\nLaying an area rug over broadloom or wall-to-wall carpeting can hide a worn or soiled spot in the carpet, add some personal style to a rented space, or simply look luxurious. But can you do that?\nAccording to designers, there are many benefits to styling rugs on top of carpet at home. The key is choosing the right rug material, size, and pad to prevent slipping. Here are expert-backed tips to help you do it properly.\nMEET THE EXPERT\nNadia Watts is the founder of Nadia Watts Interior Design.\nTrisha Knight is the co-founder of Knight Varga Interiors.\nCan You Put an Area Rug on Carpet?\nRugs can be layered over your carpet to achieve various aesthetic and functional results, including:\nAdding style and texture to the space \nHiding stains and damage on the carpet \nExtending the life of the carpet\nProviding extra padding underfoot\nChoose the Right Style for Your Carpet\nChoose an area rug that's the right thickness to place over broadloom, say experts.\nWhat Is Broadloom?\nBroadloom refers to woven, wall-to-wall carpeting seen typically in bedrooms, living rooms, and basements.\n\"Hides, kilims, and dhurries all look great layered on carpet because of their low profile,\" Nadia Watts, the founder of Nadia Watts Interior Design, explains. \"You don't want to layer a rug on carpet that is too thick or textured; try to stick with natural materials and lower profiles,\" she advises.\nTrisha Knight, the co-founder of the design firm Knight Varga Interiors, agrees. Knight says the bottom carpet should always be heavier in weight and texture than the rug on top of it.\n\"The top rug becomes a feature framed by the bottom rug,\" Knight explains. \"We will often do this with a natural woven rug on the bottom and a light vintage-inspired rug or natural shag on top.\"\nIn addition, avoid mixing patterns when layering rugs. Ideally, Knight says, your top area rug should be patterned, and your carpet should be a solid color. The solid-colored carpet will balance out the pattern of the area rug.\nPicking The Right Area Rug Color\nIf you plan on layering a solid color area rug over a solid color carpet, avoid clashing tones by choosing a complementary hue. Using a color wheel is helpful. Or, choose an area rug with the same color as the carpet underneath but in a different texture.\nRug Size Matters\nThe Spruce / Jessica Lombardi\nThe area rug's size must fit the room's scale. Rugs that are too small for the space look awkward and out of place. The general rule of thumb is to keep all four legs or the front two legs of a major piece of furniture on top of the area rug.\nAlso, leave between 6 and 24 inches of floor or broadloom carpet space showing as a border around each side of the area rug.\nIf you're working with a small room, use an appropriately sized rug for the space. A larger area rug can be an advantage in a smaller space.\n\"A large area rug will make a room feel bigger,\" Knight says.\nAnchor the Rug\nNadia Watts Interior Design\nIt's important to anchor an area rug layered on a carpet to keep it from shifting and creating a falling hazard. A properly anchored area rug stops unwanted ripples, prevents people from tripping over it, and keeps the rug from sliding. An area rug may move depending on its backing and the carpeting's style.\nUse Furniture as Anchors\nAnchor an area rug under a bed or sofa to ensure the edges are secure and won't move. Ideally, furniture should hold the area rug down on all four sides. However, if the piece is heavy enough, anchoring the rug on two opposite sides may be enough to stop movement.\nNon-Slip Rug Pad\nWatts also advises using a rug pad when placing an area rug over a carpet. \"Rugs will add friction to your flooring—no matter what's underneath—so use a pad to protect and prolong the life of the carpet,\" Watts says.\nNon-slip rug pads designed for holding an area rug over broadloom are called \"carpet-to-carpet\" pads. These pads prevent an area rug from shifting and rippling over the carpet. Pads also reduce premature wear or blooming of the carpet fibers underneath the area rug caused by repeated friction from movement.\nThe effectiveness of carpet-to-carpet pads varies because of many factors, including quality, the carpet's style, the area rug's backing, and fiber types.\nConsider anchoring the area rug by combining heavy furniture with a pad underneath. This helps if one side of the area rug cannot be anchored. However, use a carpet-to-carpet non-slip pad to prevent ripples in an area rug in a foyer or hallway that can't be anchored by furniture.\nRug Tape\nSecure your area rug with rug tape, also called rug gripper. Rug tape is a double-sided adhesive that anchors area rugs to the floor. It is very sticky and comes in various forms of adhesives, including silicone, rubber, and glue.\nA drawback of rug tape is that the wrong type may pull at the fibers of your carpet and area rug when removed. It is also single-use only, so once you pull it up one time, the tape loses its grip.\nRugs Over Carpet: A Yes, If You Wish\nAmy Leferink at Interior Impressions\nDesigners say rugs can be layered over carpet if they are low profile and properly sized for the room. However, if you dislike how it looks, don't layer. Your space should reflect your personal style and design choices. Your home should feel like you.\nFAQ\nIs putting a rug on carpet OK?\nThere are many benefits to placing a rug over a carpet. A layered look infuses personality, conceals stains and damage on the carpet, extends the carpet's lifespan, and provides extra cushion to your floor.\nDo rug grippers work on carpet?\nRug gripper, called rug tape, works on all floor surfaces, including carpet.\nHow do you put a rug on carpet without bunching it?\nProperly anchoring an area rug over the carpet is key to preventing bunching. Some anchoring methods include using rug tape, a rug pad, or furniture.\nCan you nail or screw a rug down on carpet?\nYes, you can screw or nail a rug down on a carpet as a means of anchoring it.\nDo I need a rug pad when using an area rug on carpet?\nYes, use a rug pad under an area rug layered on a carpet. While you don't need the extra padding, a rug pad protects your carpet from wear.\nBest Rug Roungups\n16 Area Rugs We Love For Every Type of Decor\nAfter Testing Washable Rugs, Here Are the Best We Recommend\nWe Tested Hundreds of Affordable Rugs, But These 8 Are the Best Bang for Your Buck\nThe 8 Best Rug Pads of 2024, Tested and Reviewed"

  "articleText": "HOME DESIGN & DECORATING DECORATING\n6 Ways to Flatten an Area Rug\nBy JENNIFER LESSER\nand MARIA SABELLA\nUpdated on 12/13/24\nThe Spruce / Meg MacDonald\nIN THIS ARTICLE\nBefore You Begin\nInstructions\nWhen to Call a Professional\nChoosing the Right Method\nFAQ\nBACK TO TOP\nPROJECT OVERVIEW\nWORKING TIME: 5 mins - 1 hr\nTOTAL TIME: 2 hrs - 2 days\nSKILL LEVEL: Beginner\nESTIMATED COST: $0 to $10\nWhether you just unrolled a new area rug or have an old one whose corners keep curling, knowing how to flatten a rug comes in handy. A newly purchased rug or one in storage for an extended period is often curled, wrinkled, or misshapen. But fear not, these easy-to-follow and inexpensive methods will help you flatten it out for a neat appearance and prevent a tripping hazard.\nBelow, we've rounded up six DIY methods to help flatten an area rug, read on to find out which one will work the best for you.\nBefore You Begin\nBefore turning to more elaborate measures, a rug may need some time to flatten itself. If you've just unrolled a new area rug with some ripples from packing or shipping, start by laying it out, smoothing it down to be as flat as possible, and then leaving it alone for a day or two.\nThis will cause the fibers to relax and the area rug will begin flattening itself. If you eventually plan to layer the rug over a larger area rug or place it on wall-to-wall carpeting, lay it out on hard flooring while it relaxes for best results.\nArea Rug Rules of Thumb to Follow\nMany methods for flattening an area rug require no tools or materials. Additional supplies, if necessary, may already be found in your home.\nWhat You'll Need\nEquipment / Tools\nClothes iron\nHair dryer\nHeavy objects such as books\nMaterials\nDouble-sided carpet tape\nKraft paper (optional)\nInstructions\nHow to Flatten a Rug\nMethod 1: Flip the Rug\nMany rugs will have curled corners even after you unroll them and the rug relaxes. If that happens, your next step depends on how the corners curl.\nIf they curl upward, fold them slightly under and leave them alone for a day or two. But if they're curling under, you'll want to flip the rug over and curl the corners under, or weigh down each corner with a heavy object (books, furniture, etc.) to help force the carpet fibers to relax and flatten out.\nPros\nInexpensive\nRequires minimal effort\nCons\nNot instant\nMethod 2: Tape Down the Rug\nIf you're looking for a fast way to flatten your rug, head to your local furniture or home improvement store and buy double-sided carpet tape.\nWhen applied to the back of your rug, the tape will adhere to the floor and hold the rug in place. It effectively flattens existing creases and prevents new ones. Carpet tape generally works on hard floors and existing wall-to-wall carpets, just be sure to press firmly and smooth down the rug before adhering.\nCOMMON PITFALLS\nSome tape adhesions are too harsh or sticky and can damage the floor's surface, the rug's backing, or fibers. Read the packaging to determine if the adhesive is heavy-duty or easy to remove. Check if the tape is specifically used for indoor, outdoor, smooth, or textured surfaces.\nPros\nWorks fast\nWorks on multiple surfaces\nCons\nRequires a purchase\nAdhesives may damage floor or rug\nMethod 3: Back-Roll the Rug\nUnroll your area rug and then roll it again in the opposite direction to reverse the curling. If this trick doesn't work right away, let the rolled carpet sit for a day or two before unrolling it again the other way.\nPros\nNo supplies required\nCons\nCan take several days\nMethod 4: Use a Clothes Iron\nIron the curled area on your rug on a low setting using a clothes iron. Use a barrier between the iron's heat and the rug. Kraft paper works well for this purpose. Never use thinner printer paper or wax paper as a barrier when ironing.\nWARNING\nKeep the ironing to a minimum temperature to prevent scorching, melting, and other heat damage.\nPros\nQuick results\nCons\nCould cause heat damage\nMay take long to cover whole rug\nMethod 5: Lay the Rug in the Sun\nSpread your rug over clean concrete or asphalt outdoors on a dry and sunny afternoon. The ideal temperature is between 75°F and 80°F because the ground has had time to absorb the sun's heat.\nLeaving the rug under direct sunlight for a little while is often all it takes to release any creases or wrinkles.\nPros\nNo supplies needed\nCons\nThere are necessary weather conditions\nMethod 6: Use a Hair Dryer\nOpt for a hairdryer to apply gentle heat onto the back of the rug to release creases. Hold the hairdryer 6 to 9 inches from the rug to prevent the fibers from melting. Use a sweeping motion on a low to medium setting instead of holding it steady in one position.\nPros\nMethod uses a common household tool\nWorks fast\nCons\nCare is needed not to melt the fibers\nWhen to Call a Professional\nWith very expensive or valuable rugs, such as Persian rugs, it may be best to consult a professional from the get-go, as they are well equipped to move and flatten rugs. Most everyday rugs will respond to the easy DIY methods for flattening, but if they don't, two professional methods can be applied: steaming and stretching.\nSteaming: Depending on the construction of your rug, a professional service may be able to steam it to remove the creases. However, you must test the rug for colorfastness before attempting this method. The steaming process can potentially ruin your rug and make the colors bleed.\nStretching: Another option is asking a local carpet dealer to stretch the carpet out. Wrinkles will release if it's slowly pulled taut. This job is best left to professionals because stretching can damage the rug if not done correctly.\nHOW TO MAINTAIN\nIf you're putting an area rug in a high-traffic area, don't stress! Area rugs are easier to maintain than wall-to-wall carpets. You can keep area rugs clean by spot cleaning with a small appliance or you can purchase a washable rug and toss it in the machine.\nThe Spruce / Meg MacDonald\nHow to Choose the Right Method\nTo choose the right method for flattening your area rug, consider the material, how severely creased or curled it is, its age, style, weight, and what supplies you have.\nFor a standard area rug that's not antique or highly valuable, start with a DIY method that does not require purchasing supplies. Give it a few days to see if it's effective and if not, opt for a more involved method or possibly professional treatment to flatten your area rug.\nBest Rugs Roundup\n16 Area Rugs We Love For Every Type of Decor\nAfter Testing Washable Rugs, Here Are the Best We Recommend\nThe 20 Best Places to Buy Rugs Online of 2024\n1 of 2\nFAQ\nHow long does it take to flatten an area rug?\nIt could take days to a few weeks to flatten an area rug depending on the severity of the bumps.\nCan you flatten a rug by steaming it?\nYes, steaming can help flatten a rug but this method is best left to the professionals. Steaming can potentially damage a rug. Don't try DIY steaming unless the rug is colorfast and washable.\nHow can you get your rug to lay flat after washing?\nAfter washing, your rug will need heat to help it lay flat. Leave it in the sun for a few hours to help eliminate wrinkles as it dries. If this doesn't work, follow the steps above."

  "articleTitle": "7 Easy Hacks to Keep Bees and Wasps Away from Your Outdoor Dining Area",
  "articleText": "GARDENING PLANT PROBLEMS GARDEN PESTS\n7 Easy Hacks to Keep Bees and Wasps Away from Your Outdoor Dining Area\nBy LAUREN LANDERS\nPublished on 09/12/24\nMelanieMaya / Getty Images\nThere are few better ways to enjoy the outdoors than throwing a garden dinner party or backyard barbecue with friends.\nBut, bees love human foods almost as much as we do—and can quickly spoil an outdoor meal by buzzing guests and trying to sneak a taste of hamburgers, watermelon, and sugary sweet drinks.\nIf you want to avoid nasty stings and host a bug-free picnic, here’s how to keep bees away from your table in a totally bee-safe way.\nChoose a Good Location\nBees are more likely to pester picnics that are located near active beehives, so avoid placing your picnic table in areas where you see lots of bees buzzing around.\nWhile you’re at it, clean up spills and trash as soon as you can, and keep your picnic far from compost bins or trash barrels. These smelly places can also attract bees with the sweet scent of fermenting food.\nSkip Strong Scents\nRuslanDashinsky / Getty Images\nFermenting garbage isn’t the only smell that attracts bees. Bees also love sweet and floral fragrances and are often drawn in by strongly scented perfumes, body washes, soaps, shampoos, and laundry detergents.\nWhile you don’t need to always pick your perfume with bees in mind, if you’re worried about unwanted bees dropping by your party, you may want to use unscented soaps and shampoo on the day of your picnic or outdoor event.\nAvoid Floral Prints and Bright Colors\nWine, fruit, cheese and bread at picnic Getty Images / David Buffington\nBecause bees associate flowers and bright colors with nectar and pollen, it’s best to avoid using brightly colored fabrics and florals near outdoor food tables. Decking out buffets and potluck tables with white napkins and tablecloths will make these spaces less interesting to bees and help keep your food safe.\nTIP\nIf you still want to decorate with colorful prints and florals, use these items in an out-of-the-way spot that’s far from the food table.\nMow Early\nElena Medoks / Getty Images\nBees spend a lot of their time foraging for clover and other flowers in tall lawn grass and other overgrown areas, so it’s always a good idea to mow your lawn a day or two before hosting a garden party.\nThis will help your lawn look tidier, but it will also reduce the amount of flowering plants in your grass and make your lawn less inviting to bees. Once your party is through, you can let your grass grow a little longer to invite pollinators back in.\nKeep Food Covered\nIf you want your picnic to be completely bee-proof, your best bet is to place your food table under a netted canopy. But you can also reduce bee activity by keeping plates and drinks covered with netting, lids, or an overturned plate until the food is served. The longer you keep food containers closed, the less time bees will have to scent out your picnic and fly in.\nUse a Decoy\nAndrew Magill / Flickr / CC BY 2.0\nGardeners often use sacrificial “trap crops” to draw pests away from valuable veggies and flowers, and you can use a similar technique at your picnic by offering decoy foods to hungry bees.\nTry placing a shallow dish of soda, fruit juice, sugar water, or barbecue scraps out about 20 minutes before you intend to serve your main meal and locate the decoy dish far from your food table. This should entice bees and other insects away from your dinner and leave your picnic in peace. \nTry a Repellant\ndaoleduc / Getty Images\nThere are lots of repellents that allegedly deter bees, but many of these products aren’t bee-safe and some of them actually increase bee activity.\nLemongrass, for instance, is often touted as a bee repellant, but beekeepers use lemongrass oil as a pheromone-like product to lure bees to hives.\nMarigolds are also often recommended as bee deterrents, but bees feed from marigold flowers and they’re unlikely to be repelled by potted marigolds placed strategically on picnic tables.1\nIf you do want to use repellant products, look for repellants that contain eucalyptus, peppermint, or citronella oil, and avoid spraying these products on plant flowers as even natural oils can harm 1\nAlternatively, you may want to place some citronella candles or fabric softener sheets near your picnic table or wear bug spray.\nThese deterrents are not 100% effective against bees, but they should make your party less inviting to insects and they won’t do serious harm to pollinators if you use them the right way.\nArticle Sources"

Making a homemade flea trap is easy, inexpensive, and effective. It also helps you avoid calling pest control while saving your pets and upholstery from an out-of-control infestation. Keep reading to learn how to determine if you have fleas, ideas for homemade flea traps, and tips to prevent fleas from coming back.\nHow Do You Know You Have Fleas?\nIf you have pets, you're probably familiar with the preventive methods to protect your pet and your home from a flea infestation. But that doesn't mean it's always foolproof, particularly during their most active seasons in summer and fall.\nFleas are tiny (just 1/8-inch long) and their oval-shaped, dark brown bodies are flat, which lets them easily make their way through an animal's fur. If a pet does fall victim to fleas, which feed on blood, it can cause itching and irritation, often the first sign that you have a flea problem.\nHowever, find out if they've made their way beyond your pet and onto your carpets and furniture by walking around in a high pair of white socks. Because fleas are known to jump onto their victims, it won't be long before you'll find these tiny dark brown pests latched onto your white socks, hoping to find a new mammal to feast on.\nTip\nFleas can be easily mixed up with another small pest: the bed bug, especially if you discover bites at night. The easiest way to tell the difference is whether you have pets. No pets? It might be bed bugs.\nWhat Attracts Fleas?\nFleas are attracted to many things around your home that make it difficult for them to leave. They prefer warm, humid, dark places, like your pet's fur. Fleas are drawn to the scent of pets, wildlife, clothing, skin, and dirty areas such as garbage. They are also likely to lay their eggs somewhere soft, like carpet or fabric.\nAre Fleas Difficult to Get Rid Of?\nA flea's life cycle can last months to years, making them difficult to eliminate, especially if they've laid eggs throughout your home. The key to treating them is consistency. Once you find fleas in your home, continue taking action so the situation doesn't worsen. Luckily, these three DIY flea traps will help you continuously work to prevent the flea problem from returning without having to hire the help of outside pest control.\nWHILE YOU'RE AT IT\nUse all of these methods to attract and kill more than just fleas. The soapy water and corn syrup methods placed appropriately can attract and kill many other small flying insects found indoors, such as mosquitos, fungus gnats, moths, beetles, fruit flies, drain flies, and little flying ants. The sticky tape method below can also catch small flying insects plus larger crawling pests.\nWhat You'll Need\nEquipment / Tools\nSoapy Water Method\nDesk lamp\nShallow plate or bowl\nSticky Tape Method\nDesk lamp\nCorn Syrup Method\nPot for boiling\nShallow bowl\nDesk lamp\nMaterials\nSoapy Water Method\n2﻿ tablespoons dishwashing detergent\n1﻿ cup water\nSticky Tape Method\nDouble-sided sticky tape\n1﻿ piece cardboard (flat)\nCorn Syrup Method\nCorn syrup\nWater\nInstructions\nThe Spruce / Ana Cadena\nHow to Make a Soapy Water Flea Trap\nChoose the Right Placement\nDetermine where you're seeing the most flea activity—this is where you'll want to set up the trap, making sure it's within cord distance of an electrical outlet.\nWARNING\nLiquid near electricity is dangerous. Ensure the area cannot be accessed by children or pets. If liquid does splash onto the outlet or a wire, turn off the electricity immediately and unplug anything connected to the outlet. Do not touch the outlet directly. Allow it to dry for 24 hours and call an electrician to assess the damage before plugging a wire back in.\nAdd Water and Dish Soap\nFill a shallow bowl with water, then add a tablespoon of dish soap.\nTurn on a Desk Lamp\nPlace a desk lamp with targeted light directly above the shallow bowl. Turn off all other lights in the room. This is best done at night.\nWait for the Fleas to Jump Into the Dish\nFleas are attracted to the warmth of the light and will try to jump towards it, landing in the soapy water in the process. The dish soap ensures that the fleas won't be able to get out of the water (otherwise they'd bounce off the top because they're so lightweight), and they'll drown.\nHow to Make a Sticky Tape Method\nChoose the Right Spot\nSimilarly to the soapy water method, find a spot where fleas are most active in your home, located near an electrical outlet.\nPlace the Tape on the Cardboard\nPlace a piece of cardboard along the ground and cover it with double-sided sticky tape.\nTurn on a Desk Lamp\nTurn on a targeted desk lamp directly above the cardboard. Turn off all other lights in the room.\nWait for the Fleas to Stick\nThe fleas will jump towards the warmth of the light at night, landing on the sticky trap, where they won't be able to escape and will die.\nTip\nHistorically, many of these methods used a lit candle rather than a lamp. However, that poses a fire hazard and is not worth the risk. A task lamp, like a desk lamp, allows you to target the light directly on the trap and will provide enough light and warmth to do the trick.\nHow to Make a Corn Syrup Flea Trap\nChoose the Right Spot for the Trap\nDetermine where the fleas are most active. Similarly to the other two methods, you'll again want to find a spot in a dark room within cord distance of an electrical outlet.\nMix Water and Corn Syrup\nBring equal parts corn syrup and water to a boil in a pot over high heat. Turn the heat off and let the mixture cool down completely.\nPut the Mixture Into a Bowl\nPour the corn syrup and water mixture into a shallow bowl.\nTrap the Fleas in the Mixture\nPlace the bowl directly under a desk lamp. As with the other two methods, the fleas will be attracted to the warmth of the light and will jump towards it. They'll land into the sticky corn syrup mixture and won't be able to escape.\nOther Flea Trap Tips\nDeep clean window sills, vents, and any gaps between the inside and outside of your house.\nVacuum thoroughly, bathe your pet regularly, and deep clean any favorite pet resting areas and toys.\nWash your bedding and upholstery on hot or with a steam cleaner.\nClean the surfaces of your furniture often with a good wood or upholstery cleaner.\nSprinkle baking soda or food-grade diatomaceous earth around the base of your furniture.\nWhen to Call a Professional\nIf your infestation becomes severe, it can be worth hiring out the job and bringing in a pest control service to address this issue. After addressing the situation, start a cleaning routine that keeps fleas out of your home.\nFAQ\nHow effective are flea traps?\nFlea traps are effective at controlling adult fleas and pinpointing the source. However, flea traps alone cannot eliminate flea eggs, larvae, and pupae in the home.\nWhich type of trap kills fleas the quickest?\nTraps that fleas can ingest orally are the most effective traps to use. Fleas will ingest a poison they will bring back and spread to the colony, killing the source.\nWhat scent deters fleas?\nFragrances and essential oils such as lavender, cedarwood, eucalyptus, thyme, and peppermint have been know to deter fleas. They are also known to stay away from anything that smells like citrus.\nWhat lures fleas to a trap overnight?\nFleas are attracted to warmth and light. Set a trap near a warm lamp. Expect the fleas to jump up toward the light, so place the trap underneath the light."

  "articleText": "HOME DESIGN & DECORATING DECORATING HOME ACCESSORIES\n6 Tips for Layering Area Rugs\nBy LAUREN FLANAGAN\nUpdated on 03/18/24\nThe Spruce / Jason Donnelly\nIN THIS ARTICLE\n1. Define a Space\n2. Highlight an Area\n3. Consider Color\n4. Play With Pattern\n5. Experiment With Texture\n6. Prevent Tripping or Falling Hazards\nSimple Rules\nFAQ\nBACK TO TOP\nThe layering rugs trend invites designers to play with color, pattern, and texture when designing to set the tone for a space. One of the benefits of layering an area rug over a wall-to-wall carpet or another existing rug is it protects the rug underneath while adding another unique element to the room. One of the best layering tricks is to combine textures, like incorporating a natural fiber like jute, sisal, or animal hair, with a simple patterned rug.\nHere are six tips for making this decorating technique work for you.\n16 Area Rugs We Love For Every Type of Decor\n1. Define a Space\nIf you have a large seating area and don't want to have an island of furniture in one area, also referred to as \"floating furniture,\" layering rugs can help define a space.\nArea rug rules state that there should be approximately 10 to 20 inches of bare floor between the edges of the area rug and the room walls and that all furniture should be on the rug. However, if this composition isn't quite working for your space and everything feels a little too big and spaced out, layering a smaller rug in the center of the room can help ground the area and give it a definition. \nRugs also allow you to play with the lines and angles of the room and draw the eye where you want it. You can angle a top rug on the bias or at a 45- to 90-degree angle. Your larger base rug should be placed straight and aligned with the furniture. You can then take your smaller accent rug and change its orientation.\nExperiment with it and see if you like the look. Usually, putting the rug on a bias will call attention to it, so think if this is your intention or if you'd prefer that the eye focus elsewhere.\nTip\nLayering rugs work best when your two rugs are different sizes. One should be large and more dominant, and the others should be smaller and act as an accent. For example, a 9-inch by 12-inch rug would look great with a 6-inch by 9-inch rug layered on top. An easy rule of thumb: Make sure the top rug is about 2/3 the size of the rug underneath.\n2. Highlight an Area\nLayering a small rug on top of a larger one can direct the eye to that area. So, if you have a coffee table, bench, chest, or some other type of special piece you want to highlight, layering a rug is an excellent way to do it.\nIt's also great for doing the opposite—drawing your attention away from an area. If you've got a piece of furniture or architectural element you want to mask, a small rug in another part of the room can pull the eye away. \nThe Spruce / Jason Donnelly\n3. Consider Color\nThe main reason people like to layer rugs is that it allows them to experiment with color. Some people find a colored carpet covering their entire floor too much, so layering allows for a neutral base with a smaller infusion of color. For other people, a single rug doesn't offer enough color. Fortunately, there's no reason why you can't layer color on color. The key is to find colors that complement each other and the rest of the items in the room. Layer away to your heart's content.\nThe Spruce / Jason Donnelly\n4. Play With Pattern\nLayering patterned rugs on top of each other is a little trickier than layering a patterned rug on a solid rug, but it's possible. When experimenting with this look, try to use colors of the same intensity. For instance, don't mix pastels with jewel tones.\nDifferent patterns can often work together if they are in the same hue family. Also, think about tone-on-tone patterns. They can give a room depth and character without coming across as too bold. Ultimately, when layering patterns, it's best to trust your eye and go with your gut. If you like the way it looks, then go with it.\n5. Experiment With Texture\nYou don't need to use multiple colors and patterns to make this look work for your home—layering rugs with different textures on top of each other is a fabulous way to add depth to a room. Consider a cowhide rug on top of a sisal rug, a sheepskin on top of a jute rug, or anything soft on top of a flat weave—add interest in a more subtle but equally effective way.\nThe Spruce / Jason Donnelly\n6. Prevent Tripping or Falling Hazards\nAny area rug, whether one or several, is a potential tripping hazard. Rugs can bunch up on top or move from the bottom if not anchored with a rug pad. A rug pad keeps the rugs above it from sliding around. A piece of heavy furniture on top, like a coffee table, can also anchor down a top-layered rug.\nBe mindful of the edges; they can sometimes roll up. Curling edges can be flattened with special rug tape, or you can use a few tricks to keep the edges down: back-rolling, applying heat (iron or hair dryer), or weighing it down with heavy books.\nRules for Layering Rugs\nTips are suggestions; meanwhile, rules are stricter guidelines. Here are a few simple rules about rug layering.\nConsider using a neutral color for a rug base to give you more options for the top rug.\nLayer with complementary sizes; the rugs shouldn't be too close or far apart in size—consider a rug that is between more than 1/2 to up to 2/3 the size of the bottom one.\nWatch the thickness and avoid having a mound of rugs that can become a tripping hazard.\nCombine different textured rugs to make the layered rug effect interesting.\nMake sure the patterns and shapes are similar or match; incongruous shapes or patterns that clash will affect the balance of the space.\nRemember: All rules can be broken if you love it, feel good about your space, and know it works for you and your household.\nFAQ\nDo layered rugs remain in style?\nThe trend of layering rugs appears here to stay; it can always work in an eclectically styled space or a space with a traditional or contemporary design.\nWhen is it a good idea to layer a rug?\nIf you have a large room with a lot of open space but want to create a seating area or conversation nook, a layered rug area calls attention to one spot as a focal point and is a good anchor spot for seating.\nDo you need to use rug pads when layering rugs?\nIf your bottom rug is on a hard surface, get a rug pad so it does not move or slide. As long as the top rug has some grips that keep it anchored to the bottom rug, preventing curling or rippling, the top rug will not require a rug pad.\nHow to Choose the Right Area Rug"

  "articleText": "GARDENING PLANT PROBLEMS GARDEN PESTS\nHow to Keep the Flea Beetle at Bay\nHow to Detect an Infestation and Get Rid of It\nBy DAVID BEAULIEU\nUpdated on 05/24/23\nReviewed by KATHLEEN MILLER\nThe Spruce / Michela Buttignol\nIN THIS ARTICLE\nFlea Beetle Profile\nPlants Impacted\nInfestation Signs\nPrevention and Control\nBACK TO TOP\nDo not let flea beetles go undetected in your garden. Ignoring these insects for too long can result in extensive damage, including stunted plant growth, blighted leaves, and wilting. Not only do they eat holes in plants, but they can also spread plant diseases. Young plants may even die if attacked.\nYou will save yourself a lot of time, effort, and money by learning what the symptoms of an infestation are beforehand so that you can be on the lookout for these garden pests.\nProfile of the Flea Beetle\nThe flea beetle is a type of jumping beetle; it is its large, powerful hind legs that allow it to leap, which is what it typically does when disturbed. In fact, it gets its common name from the fact that its jumping behavior reminds people of the way fleas (Siphonaptera) jump around. There are many genera; examples include:\nAltica\nAphthona\nBlepharida\nThe different genera do not all look alike. Most flea beetles, however, have the following traits:\nThey are about 1/16 inch long.\nThey are often black. But, less commonly, they can be tan or other colors (including mixed colors).\nTheir shell is shiny.\nThe different types of flea beetles are sometimes named for the specific plants that they target. For example, the potato flea beetle (Epitrixcucumeris) eats potato plants, while the spinach flea beetle (Disonycha xanthomelas) eats spinach.\nFlea Beetle Life Cycle\nFlea beetles have a life cycle that involves a larval stage and an adult stage. They do damage to plants in both stages, but the damage done in each stage is different. The life cycle (which varies somewhat according to the species) is as follows:\nIn late fall, the adults burrow down into your garden's soil, leaf litter, or garden debris to overwinter (some types may go into wooded areas).\nThey become active in spring and start eating the leaves of your plants when outdoor temperatures climb consistently to about 50ºF. This is when the worst damage is done, especially considering that this is also when young plants (which are affected the worst) are emerging.\nIn summer these adults lay the eggs that will result in the next generation of flea beetles. These eggs are laid at the base of a plant's stems.\nWhen the eggs hatch, the larvae that come out eat the roots of your plants for 2 or 3 weeks.\nAfter undergoing a short (about 1 week) pupal stage, they emerge as adults. They then start to eat the leaves of plants. It's this second generation that does the most damage to fall crops before overwintering.\nPlants Commonly Damaged by the Flea Beetle\nFlea beetles feed on a variety of plants, including weeds such as pigweed (Amaranthus spp.). Vegetable plants are especially prone to damage from flea beetles; examples include:\nBroccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italica)\nCabbage (Brassica oleracea)\nEggplant (Solanum melongena)\nWatermelons (Citrillus lunatus)\nPeppers (Capsicum annuum)\nRadishes (Raphanus sativus)\nTomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum)\nTurnips (Brassica rapa)\nBut some ornamental plants are also eaten by flea beetles, including:\nDogwood (Cornus spp.)\nCrepe myrtle (Lagerstroemia spp.)\nGardenia\nSymptoms of a Flea Beetle Infestation\nBecause the different types of flea beetles do not all look alike, it is easier to detect an infestation based on what the damage that they cause looks like.\nFlea beetles chew irregular holes in the foliage of plants. Some of the holes go all the way through the leaf; others do not, merely leaving a blemish. The resulting damage is sometimes called a \"shothole wound\" because it looks like the result of a miniature shotgun having been fired at the affected leaf.\nSteps to Take for Flea Beetle Control\nThe best way to control flea beetles is not to let them gain a foothold in your garden in the first place. Preventive steps that you can take include:\nGrowing certain strong-smelling plants in the garden that tend to repel flea beetles. One example is catnip (Nepeta cataria)\nPlacing row covers over your garden crops\nKeeping your garden free of weeds in early spring so that emerging flea beetles have less to feed upon\nDelaying the planting of crops in spring if possible. This deprives flea beetles of needed early sustenance. Plants also grow more vigorously in warmer weather and are better able to withstand flea beetle feeding\nTilling your garden in late fall, which disturbs those flea beetles attempting to overwinter in your soil.\nMaking sure that you pick up any garden debris that flea beetles might want to overwinter in when you put your garden to bed for the winter.\nIf you have not been fortunate enough to have enjoyed success at preventing flea beetles and find yourself with an infestation, you can address it through either application of pesticides or by other methods:\nApply Neem oil, which is organic.\nApply any of the other commonly sold pesticides that are labeled as being effective against flea beetles. For example, pyrethrum-based and spinosad-based pesticides are widely available at home-improvement stores.\nAttract beneficial insects to the garden (or buy them). Examples that eat the larvae of flea beetles are braconid wasps (Microctonus vittatae) and tachinid flies (Tachinidae family).\nIf you are confident that you can identify a flea beetle by looking at it, then sticky traps are also effective. Check your sticky traps regularly and inspect them for flea beetles. If you find any, take control measures immediately. Spring is the best time to set out sticky traps."

  "articleText": "CLEANING & ORGANIZING PEST CONTROL SPIDER & INSECT CONTROL\n7 Simple Flea Removal Techniques for Your Home\nSay Goodbye to Fleas For Good\nBy SARAH AGUIRRE\nUpdated on 08/23/24\nReviewed by AMANDA ROSE NEWTON\nFact checked by EMILY ESTEP\n Catherine Falls Commercial / Getty Images \nIN THIS ARTICLE\nCauses\nSigns\nWhat You'll Need\nRemoval Methods\nPrevention\nFAQ\nBACK TO TOP\nYour pet is a member of the family, but sometimes it can unknowingly invite an unwelcome guest that puts you on flea removal patrol. Fleas jump on and off animals from the ground, so if your dog or cat goes outdoors, it will likely bring them indoors. Fleas are one of a home's most annoying insect infestations, mainly because they bury themselves in carpets, couches, and seemingly every corner of a room. Here's how to get rid of fleas in the house quickly and keep them from returning.\nWhat Causes Fleas?\nSeveral things can bring fleas into the home:\nPets: Fleas may attach to pets, especially cats and dogs, after they've been outside. After being carried into the house, they can drop off a pet's fur and lay eggs.\nFurniture: When you bring new furniture or rugs into the home, you may unknowingly bring the fleas attached to the items. Both new and previously owned items could contain fleas.\nWildlife: Fleas easily attach to wildlife like squirrels and raccoons. When they roam your yard, the fleas come closer to your home and, ultimately, inside.\nGuests: Any guest entering the home could have a flea attached to their clothing, coat, or any personal belongings.\nCracks and Crevices: Any small crack or crevice in a wall, doorway or window can act as a gateway for fleas.\nSigns of a Flea Infestation\nCertainly, if you see fleas moving around anywhere inside, you have a problem. But even if you don't see them hopping around, look for other signs.\nIf you see your pet scratching constantly, this is a surefire sign that fleas are in your home. Look for flea \"dirt\" or fecal matter and tiny, oval, off-white eggs on their skin. These flea droppings are black specs that can also linger on your bedding and carpeting. Lastly, if you see bites on your pets or your skin of unknown origins, these may be caused by fleas.\nTip\nThe key to successfully getting rid of fleas fast is consistent treatment of your pet and home. The typical length of time it takes to get rid of fleas depends on the treatment you use, but it can take weeks or months to interrupt the life cycle of every flea. Some flea treatment products and sprays for the house and pets kill fleas on contact or in a day, but that might not stop the life cycle of emerging fleas.1\nWhat You Need to Remove Fleas\nFlea treatment for pets\nVacuum cleaner\nWashing machine\nCommercial flea products or services\nWays to Remove Fleas\nRid Pets of Fleas First\nTreat the cause of the fleas first; usually, an infestation occurs because of a pet.2 Your pet can transfer fleas onto furniture and beds, so it's essential to take this step first. Treat your pets for fleas, including a prevention flea collar or medicine, before you go to all the work of ridding your home of fleas. Ask your vet if a treatment called nitenpyram (the brand name is Capstar) is right for your dog or cat because it can usually get rid of fleas within 24 hours.3\nVacuum\nVacuuming is one of the best ways to remove fleas in your home because it will kill the major percentage of adult fleas, young fleas, and eggs.4 Move furniture and vacuum thoroughly. Don't forget to use your vacuum cleaner attachment to vacuum the edges of the room and hard-to-reach corners. Remove the bag, dump the bin, and throw out the trash when finished.\nWash Linens\nUse the warmest water that can be tolerated for the clothing, washing any pillows, bedding, or other fabrics that may have been exposed to fleas. You can use a regular liquid laundry detergent and dry thoroughly.\nVacuum Again\nRepeat vacuuming of the carpet, floor, and other areas will help get rid of any remaining fleas. Be sure to continue vacuuming thoroughly over the coming days. Remedying the situation will take some daily effort for the foreseeable future.\nUse Home Remedies\nBorax, a natural mineral, sodium tetraborate, which has been mined and used for thousands of years, is an effective home remedy. Sprinkle it over the affected area and then vacuum it away to help bring a speedy death to fleas. Beware; pets or children who ingest borax will become ill.5\nA homemade flea trap can be made by filling a small bowl with water and a few drops of dish soap. Place the bowl on the floor near a nightlight. With other lights around off, fleas will jump towards the light landing in the bowl and drowning. You can also consider making a homemade flea repellent for your pet to prevent the problem from happening again.\nTry Commercial Flea Sprays\nIf home remedies don't work, you can always try a pet-safe commercial flea spray. Aerosol sprays are best because they can be used in specific areas and small crevices and not unnecessarily in other areas of the home. Make sure your spray is formulated to kill fleas at all stages of life, including eggs.\nWhen applying the spray around the home, wear protective gloves and allow it to dry thoroughly.\nConsider Hiring Pest Control Help\nIf your infestation is severe, you may need the help of a professional product or pest control company that offers a flea removal service. Be cautious and follow meticulous directions if this type of intervention is needed. Protect your pets and family by thoroughly reading the company's instructions and following them diligently.\nPreventing Fleas\nThe best course of action against fleas in the home is to prevent an infestation in the first place. Vacuum carpets and furniture often, especially where pets may curl up. Wash bedding frequently, at least once every other week. Seal up any crevices beneath doorways or in window screens that can provide entry into the home.\nCertain essential oils, such as citronella and lemongrass, have been proven to repel fleas. Diffuse them into the room, or blend them with water in a spray bottle and apply them to areas where fleas might make their homes.\nFAQ\nWhat removes fleas the fastest?\nDifferent methods can work on flea removal, but for immediate removal, vacuum and steam clean or machine wash soft items upon discovery.\nWhat's the best way to break the life cycle of a flea?\nUsing a non-toxic flea spray will interrupt the life cycle of fleas in your home. Be sure to also clean infested areas and items on the same day.\nHow do I get rid of fleas in my yard?\nMowing your lawn regularly will eliminate the fleas hiding in longer grass. Avoid overwatering, as they prefer a moist environment. Spread cedar chips along fences and garden beds, as they don't like the smell. If all else fails, spray the lawn with a safe insecticide for children and pets.\nArticle Sources"

  "articleText": "GARDENING LANDSCAPING LAWN CARE\nHow Much Is a Yard of Dirt? Cost, Coverage Area and More\nBy BARBARA GILLETTE\nPublished on 02/11/23\nReviewed by ANDREW HUGHES\nWillowpix / Getty Images\nIN THIS ARTICLE\nAverage Cost of Topsoil\nCalculate How Much Topsoil You Need\nFactors Affecting Cost\nFAQ\nBACK TO TOP\nTopsoil is the uppermost layer of earth in which all plant life grows. When you break new ground for a gardening project, especially in suburban areas, adding an inch or two of topsoil increases the health and success of your landscape. Topsoil, fill dirt and sand all are soil products with topsoil most often purchased for lawns and gardens. Available in 40 pound bags from big box stores and garden nurseries, topsoil is also sold in bulk by the cubic yard at companies that specialize in landscape materials. But you might be wondering: How much is a yard of dirt? We're breaking down what you need to know below.\nWhat Is a Cubic Yard?\nA cubic yard (yd3) is a measurement of volume in the U.S. Customary and Imperial systems of measurement. It is determined by multiplying length x width x height/depth. One cubic yard is equal to 27 cubic feet.\nCost Comparison by Cubic Yard: Fill dirt, Topsoil, Sand\n Fill Dirt  $5-$15 per cubic yard\n Topsoil  $10-$55 per cubic yard\n Sand  $15-$40 per cubic yard\nAverage Cost of Topsoil\nIt can take hundreds of years for topsoil to form which begins with the breakdown of rock and decaying organic materials. This makes it a valuable natural resource and more costly that other basic soil components like fill dirt and sand. The depth and quality of your topsoil can vary greatly so obtaining a soil analysis before starting a landscaping or gardening project can save time and cost.\nRetail\nRetailers like garden centers and home improvement stores usually sell topsoil in 40 pound bags. One bag will cover an area of 12 square feet to an depth of inch. Topsoil is sold under many different brand names and content can differ. Generally, the more organic material in the product, the higher the cost. Most products fall into a range of $3 to $5 per 40 pound bag.\nBulk\nIf you just want to amend an existing bed, bagged topsoil may fill your need, however starting a new lawn or garden bed is most cost effective when material is purchased in bulk. Topsoil sold by the scoop (frontloader bucket) or truckload is measured by the cubic yard and available from companies that sell landscaping materials. Expect to pay between $12 and $55 per cubic yard. Delivery can increase this amount up to around $100 or more depending on soil quality and distance. Some retailers and garden centers also sell bulk quantities, but costs are often higher for both product and delivery.\nCalculate How Much Topsoil You Need\nA new lawn, garden or flowerbed requires from 3 to 8 inches of topsoil. One cubic yard covers 100 square feet to a depth of 3 inches. Your landscape company can help you calculate how much you need and a number of topsoil calculators can be found on the internet. If you want to tackle the math yourself, follow these steps:\nMeasure the length and width of your project.\nLength X width = square footage.\nConvert the depth requirement to a fraction of a foot. Example: 3 inches = 1/4 foot or .25\nSquare footage X depth = cubic feet\nDivide by 27 to get cubic yards\nThe Best Plant Delivery Services for 2024\nFactors Affecting Cost of Topsoil\nThe factors that can affect the cost of top soil are product quality, delivery, and where you live.\nTypes of Topsoil\nThere are different compositions for topsoil with dozens of different brand names and manufacturers. Essentially, you are choosing one of three types: black dirt, loam, or screened loam.\nBlack dirt is least expensive and is a basic mix of loam and sand with small amounts of silt and clay.\nLoam is a middle grade topsoil higher in organic materials and just slightly more costly than black dirt. Ingredients may include organic compost or composted manure.\nScreened loam is put through a fine mesh screen to eliminate weed seeds and larger particles like small rocks and wood. This is the most expensive type of topsoil with small, uniform particles well adapted for plants.\nTip\nAll topsoil contains weed seed. Screening can remove some seeds but others are simply too small to guarantee a completely weed-free product.1\nDelivery\nDelivery for bulk topsoil is a convenience and can save wear and tear on your vehicle. If you own a truck or trailer it should be rated to carry the weight of the topsoil you need to transport. Landscape companies may be equipped to deliver themselves or they may contract out for the service. If you are purchasing topsoil by the truckload, ask what type of truck is used. Rates may be based on an hourly fee or the number of miles to your home. This can raise delivery costs for rural homeowners. In more urban locations, access can be an issue, so check with your supplier to make sure the delivery vehicle can get to your property and to the final destination for depositing the load once they arrive.\nLocation\nCosts can increase for delivery in rural areas, but finding a local source may be easier. For suppliers, materials for soil products are easier to access in less populated areas. Shipping costs incurred by suppliers may be reflected in higher cost to the urban consumer.\nFAQ\nHow do I measure the amount of topsoil in my yard?\nDig down 8 inches and look for soil to become more dense and lighter in color. The darker top layer is measured as topsoil. If color stays fairly uniform, test with your shovel.2 Once you penetrate the topsoil layer, you will feel more resistance.\nHow much does a cubic yard of topsoil weigh?\nIt varies depending on how much moisture it contains. One cubic yard of dry topsoil averages around 1,080 pounds. When wet that number can increase to up to a ton or 2,000 pounds.\nHow much topsoil is in a scoop?\nA scoop of topsoil is usually equivalent to a front loader bucket full or around 1/2 cubic yard.\nHow many 40 pound bags of topsoil make a cubic yard?\nOne cubic yard of topsoil is equal to 36 (40) pound bags.3\nArticle Sources"

When guests visit, you may struggle to find matching sheets, dig for missing hand towels, or topple a tower of blankets in search of the softest pillow. Incorporating details like labeled storage baskets, decorative vases, and books will make your closet more functional and aesthetically pleasing.\nSave yourself the stress and mess with these tips to help you organize your linen closet beautifully and functionally.\nWant more cleaning and organizing tips? Sign up for our free daily newsletter for the latest hacks, expert advice, and more!\nMEET THE EXPERT\nAlisha Firestone-White is the co-owner and housekeeper at Northwest Housekeeping in Salem, Oregon.\n01\nof 20\nStart by Decluttering\ncerro_photography / Getty Images\nBefore beginning any organizing project, it's vital to declutter your items first. This is the perfect opportunity to identify and remove space-wasting items, such as worn linens, duplicate items, and expired products.\n02\nof 20\nCategorize Everything\nOceanProd / Getty Images\nTo help you design an organized system, arrange the contents of your linen closet into categories.\n\"I always like to take everything out and put things into piles,\" says Alisha Firestone-White of Northwest Housekeeping in Salem, Oregon. Some categories might include bedding, towels, and assorted products like excess toiletries.\n03\nof 20\nWork With What You Have\n@joanna_organize / Instagram\nYou don't need to spend a lot for matching storage bins to create a tidy space. Instead, search your home for under-utilized cubbies, boxes, and similar items.\n\"Almost any job I've ever been on, I can repurpose their storage containers,\" Firestone-White says.\n04\nof 20\nLabel Storage Containers\n@neatbymeg / Instagram\nOpt for a simple set of identical storage bins and apply labels to each according to the categories you previously selected.\n\"Everyone has different preferences when it comes to organizing, but I would definitely label bins,\" Firestone-White says.\nThis linen closet design from Neat by Meg is as uncluttered, tidy, and cohesive as we've seen.\nContinue to 5 of 20 below\n05\nof 20\nConsider Frequency of Use\n@nycneat_louisa / Instagram\nAs you reorganize your linen closet, don't just fold and stow. Consider which items you use the most and arrange your linens accordingly.\nFor instance, store frequently used towels and sheets in the closet's front or middle sections for easier access.\n06\nof 20\nAdd Vertical Dividers\n@afreshspace / Instagram\nAdd vertical dividers to your linen closet shelves to create a more streamlined storage system. In this closet, organized by A Fresh Space, the stacks of white and gray towels look even cleaner when divided.\n07\nof 20\nAdd Shelf Liners\nPablo Jeffs Munizaga - Fototrekking / Getty Images\nProtect your closet with shelf liners so spills and other messes are easier to clean. They can prevent bins and other containers from sliding around or tipping over easily. Not to mention, shelf liners can add a fun pop of color or texture as well.\n08\nof 20\nAim for Neutrals\n@nycneat_louisa / Instagram\nKeep your color palette subdued for an easy way to avoid a chaotic closet. Stick with neutral tones, such as grays and whites. Natural materials like wicker and rattan complement the calming aesthetic.\nContinue to 9 of 20 below\n09\nof 20\nUse Plastic Bins for Liquid Products\n@afreshspace / Instagram\nGet a set of clear plastic cubbies if you're worried about spills and stains from stored shampoo bottles and cough syrups. Not only will these make for easy clean-up should you experience a spill, but the clear exterior will make it easy to spot what you need quickly.\n10\nof 20\nInvest in Quality Organizers\nKostikova / Getty Images\nInvest in quality organizers to get the most organized linen closet possible. And sure, while it's possible, and in certain cases recommended, that you reuse storage containers to organize your linen closet, a specially designed organizer can be well worth the investment.\n\"Repurposing storage bins makes sense from a cost perspective, but in some circumstances, the right totes make better use of the space,\" Firestone-White says.\n11\nof 20\nSort and Stack Linens\n@nycneat_louisa / Instagram\nOrganize a large collection of blankets, sheets, pillows, and towels by type and then stack them accordingly. Arranging everything from hand towels to pillowcases in groups makes them easier to locate and your closet less susceptible to messes.\n12\nof 20\nConsider Storing Sheets in Sets\n@afreshspace / Instagram\nStore complete sets of sheets and pillowcases together.\n\"I prefer to keep all sets together,\" Firestone-White says. \"I like to fold it all into a pocket, with the pillowcase over the flat sheet and the fitted sheet wrapped around them.\"\nYou can easily grab a stack of sheets and avoid digging for it when guests arrive.\nContinue to 13 of 20 below\n13\nof 20\nArrange Pillows Vertically\nbeyhanyazar / Getty Images\nArrange pillows vertically instead of stacking them. This adds variety to your organization and prevents a tower of pillows from tipping over as you try to retrieve one.\n14\nof 20\nRoll Fabrics\n@neatbymeg / Instagram\nRoll your sheets, towels, and blankets to store them instead of stacking them. This is a quick and simple shift in habit to change the look of your linen closet for the better.\n15\nof 20\nLimit Groups to Twos and Threes\nmgstudyo / Getty Images\nTake this common tip from interior designers and group items in twos and threes, even in your linen closet. As you group linens, aim to sort everything into small sets, such as three rolled towels and two stacked pillows.\n16\nof 20\nAlternate Storage Solutions\n@joanna_organize / Instagram\nConsider attractive storage solutions for organizing any closet, like woven and wicker baskets.\n\"Sometimes I like to make a pattern, alternating with different colored containers or arranging each shelf with a specific bin color or style,\" Firestone-White says.\nContinue to 17 of 20 below\n17\nof 20\nLeave Breathing Room\n@afreshspace / Instagram\nWhen you begin reorganizing, make sure you're tossing or donating the items you don't use. Try incorporating some negative space in your design. Just because you have additional space in your linen closet doesn't mean you need to fill it.\n18\nof 20\nMix and Match\nAdShooter / Getty Images\nPlay around with your closet organization. Some homeowners may prefer a minimal design with matching bins and labels. For others, stacks of mismatched towels and sheets may be more appealing.\n\"Every homeowner has a different preference,\" Firestone-White says. \"Personally, I like to mix up colors for fun.\"\nExperiment with options to find the solution that best fits your taste.\n19\nof 20\nIncorporate Decor\n@joanna_organize / Instagram\nBeautify your closet aesthetic with hardcover books, porcelain bowls, or decorative shelf liners. Linen closets can be short on space but don't have to be short on style. Find the sweet spot between pretty and practical.\n20\nof 20\nDon't Overthink It\nOlga Nikiforova / Getty Images\nCreating and maintaining an organized linen closet doesn't have to be complicated. Permit yourself to utilize the above ideas that make the most sense for you and your space and do away with those that don't.\nTips for Categorizing Linens\nCategorize linens with even more tips to help you keep everything tidy and organized:\nDeclutter: Cut the excess and declutter your linens. Pull them out and decide what you want to keep, donate, and get rid of so you are left with a collection you will use.\nGroup items: Group linens based on their type, such as bedding, bath towels, and cleaning rags.\nLabel shelves: Label shelves based on the categories you've chosen so you can easily and quickly find the type of linen you're looking for.\nOptimize space: Make the most of your space with clever ways to save room such as rolling towels, storing sheets in pillowcases, using hooks, hanging a door rack, etc.\nFAQ\nHow do you maximize a deep linen closet?\nMaximize space in a deep linen closet by installing adjustable shelves, and pull-out drawers, and purchasing storage bins that fit the depth of your closet shelves.\nHow far apart should shelves be in a linen closet?\nThe items you store will determine the distance between your linen closet shelves. Organizing experts recommend spacing your shelves between 10 and 18 inches apart to accommodate stacks of common linens like towels, sheets, and even pillows.\nWhere is the best place to put a linen closet?\nYour linen closet should ideally be placed in a central location like a hallway between bedrooms. However, depending on the layout of your home, your best option for a linen closet may be within a bathroom or laundry room."

  "articleTitle": "IKEA’s Prices Are Dropping in 2024—Here’s Why",
  "articleText": "HOME NEWS BRANDS & COLLECTIONS\nIKEA’s Prices Are Dropping in 2024—Here’s Why\nIKEA is continuing to roll out low prices and new deals for customers worldwide.\nBy SOPHIA BEAMS\nPublished on 01/16/24\nMorsa Images / Getty Images\nIKEA first announced their plan to lower prices for 2024 in November, and they’ve just confirmed that they’re continuing their plan to make their prices as low as possible for all of their customers.\nSo, what happened to make IKEA change their furniture prices? Mostly, the cost of materials and transportation lowered significantly in 2023, according to Inter IKEA Group.\nKeeping Customers in Mind\nIKEA has promised to share these profits with customers; the major furniture chain is committed to giving shoppers the lowest possible prices on quality home furnishings. This means that we might see prices drop even lower in 2024, depending on how IKEA does throughout the year.\nThey’re serious about finding the best prices possible; they’ve already invested over one billion dollars into re-pricing their current stock.\nAnother major change for IKEA’s pricing came within the last two months of 2023, which was the introduction of IKEA’s New Lower Price section.\nNew Lower Price features a selection of products on IKEA’s website that have been marked down as much as possible, usually by at least 20%. The New Lower Price items can be shopped both online and in-stores, making them as accessible as possible for anyone searching for an extra deal. \nFan-Favorite Products With a New Pricetag\nThere’s no exact science as to which products IKEA is dropping prices on. Technically, they’re working hard to reduce pricing on anything and everything, but any pieces without reduced manufacturing costs will likely never see a reduction. New Lower Prices tends to feature trendy IKEA products along with a large collection of other major price drops.\n“As we celebrate the 80th anniversary of the founding of IKEA in 1943, I look forward to our next financial year when we will be able to continue to live up to our business idea of offering a wide range of well-designed, functional home furnishing products at prices so low that as many people as possible will be able to afford them,\" said CFO of Inter IKEA Group, Martin van Dam, in an Inter IKEA Group announcement,\nBut How Long Will It Last?\nCan we expect to see these low prices continue forever? It all depends on IKEA’s profits. The retailer has plans to continue increasing the efficiency of production, which lowers prices all around.\nThe business model of offering continually lower prices will actually work out well for the retailer—not only will they draw in additional customers, but they’ll also retain more of their current customer base with their unbeatable prices. So, there’s hope that IKEA’s sweet, sweet deals will stick around for a while. \nIf you’re not seeing IKEA’s prices lowering in stores near you just yet, don’t worry, the price lowering is rolling out slowly. There have been some lowered prices in 2023, but we’re expecting to see the full effects of IKEA’s price revamp in the first half of the new year.\nFor now, continue checking the New Lower Prices section in stores and online while you keep your eye on regular IKEA furniture prices."

  "articleText": "CLEANING & ORGANIZING PEST CONTROL SPIDER & INSECT CONTROL\n11 Easy, Natural Ways to Keep Fleas Away from Your Home\nBy PEPPER MORAN\nand MARY MARLOWE LEVERETTE\nUpdated on 08/13/24\nReviewed by AMANDA ROSE NEWTON\nFact checked by SARAH SCOTT\nIN THIS ARTICLE\nDeep Cleaning\nNatural Flea Remedies\nWhen to Call a Professional\nFAQs\nBACK TO TOP\nFlea infestations are common in a home with cats and dogs, and using a natural flea repellent can help with the problem. There are hundreds of flea repellents on the market but they contain chemicals. Controlling fleas with natural methods can be safer especially if you have small children.1 Products you have on hand, like salt, baking soda, dishwashing liquid, and essential oils, can repel fleas.\nHere is how to get rid of fleas with natural repellents.\nStart With Deep Cleaning\nIt can't be said enough about flea control: deep cleaning is a must. Flea eggs can lie dormant and hidden until movement triggers them to hatch, so leave no nook or cranny untouched.\nVacuum thoroughly: Don't just focus on pet beds or resting areas. Flea eggs are often trapped between the baseboard and the floorboard, and they are especially prone to piling up inside the cracks of sofas. If your pet is allowed on the furniture, vacuum the upholstery and all the cracks and crevices of your couch or chair. Always empty the vacuum dirt reservoir or dispose of the vacuum bag in an outside trash can.\nSteam clean: The steam heat will kill fleas and their eggs. Use a steam cleaner on carpets, area rugs, upholstered furniture, and mattresses. \nWash pet beds: Pet bedding should be washed in hot water or replaced once the flea infestation is eliminated. If you're working hard to get rid of fleas inside, check your dog's outside doghouse and clean it well.\nTIPS\nPets often bring fleas in from outside. If your yard isn't well maintained, rodents (mice, rats, squirrels) may be carrying fleas that could spread to your dog or cat.2\n11 Natural Flea Remedies\nDiatomaceous Earth\nDiatomaceous earth is a naturally occurring powder made from the microscopic remains of diatom algae. It penetrates the exoskeleton of a flea and kills it through dehydration. Diatomaceous earth can kill fleas within four hours. Sprinkle it around infested areas indoors and outdoors. Diatomaceous earth is non-toxic to pets and humans unless directly inhaled.3\nSalt \nSprinkling salt where fleas are active will also dehydrate the eggs and insects. Salt works well on carpets and upholstery where it can be easily vacuumed away.\nBaking Soda \nAnother desiccant, baking soda will cause fleas and their eggs to become dehydrated and die. Sprinkle it liberally and let it work for at least 24 hours before vacuuming. Be sure to dispose of the dust cup contents or bag in an outside trash can just in case some fleas are still alive.\nDish Soap \nDishwashing liquid and water trap live fleas. Fill a bowl with warm water and 1/4 cup of dish soap and place it near an area where you have a flea infestation. Put it out at night when the fleas are most active and will become trapped in the soapy solution. This does not, however, take care of the eggs that are still waiting to hatch.\nTip\nYou can combine these natural remedies in a concentrated space and illuminate it with a candle or any other light to create a light trap to hasten the process of catching the fleas. Studies have shown that fleas are attracted to both light and heat sources.4\nRosemary Oil \nFleas and ticks do not like the scent of rosemary. Plant it outside to help repel fleas from your yard. The rosemary oil can be combined with baking soda to make a flea powder to sprinkle on carpets, furniture, pet bedding, window frames, and anywhere else you suspect flea activity in your home.\nLavender Oil \nLavender is another natural flea repellent. Add a few drops of lavender oil to baking soda or cornstarch to create an herbal flea powder repellent.\nPeppermint Oil \nThe refreshing smell of mint attracts humans, but it is overpowering for fleas. Any mint oil can be used to create an herbal flea powder. Planting mint near the entrances of your home will also help keep fleas away.\nCedarwood Oil \nAdd two to three drops of cedarwood oil to two cups of water in a spray bottle to repel fleas in the home. You can also place cedar chips in bowls near flea infestations to repel the pests.\nCitrus Spray \nAdd 1/4 cup of fresh lemon juice to 2 cups of water in a spray bottle. Spray flea-infested animal bedding areas.5 They should not be used to spray entire rooms, nor should they be used outdoors. EPA-registered citrus shampoos are mild enough for young animals, but veterinarians caution that some cats may suffer if the material is applied in excessive concentrations.\nBoric Acid \nBoric acid powder acts as a desiccant to kill fleas and roaches. Use a very fine dusting on surfaces and in cracks where fleas will crawl over the powder and ingest it. Use in cracks and crevices, edges of cabinets, and on the floors behind appliances. Do not use boric acid on kitchen counters since it is slightly toxic to humans.\nBath Oil \nStudies show a reduction in fleas when animals are bathed in oil and water.6 The key is frequently washing with the solution so the fleas can't repopulate on your pet. This treatment will only work well if deep cleaning of bedding and resting spots is also done.\nWhen to Call a Professional\nIf the infestation is severe, a pest professional can help. While targeted chemical treatment can be necessary to get rid of severe flea problems, it's a band-aid solution if the source of the fleas isn't addressed.\nFAQ\nWhat is the best homemade flea repellent?\nDeep cleaning and diatomaceous earth are the best natural flea removal methods. To repel fleas, choose mint or cedarwood essential oil sprays.\nWhat kills fleas fast naturally?\nDiatomaceous earth can kill fleas within four hours through dehydration.\nDoes vinegar repel fleas?\nLike citrus solutions, distilled white vinegar diluted with water and sprayed on surfaces can repel fleas.\nORIGINALLY WRITTEN BY ERIN HUFFSTETLER\nArticle Sources"

Without proper ventilation, fungi will grow on your plants and the optimal growing conditions (temperature, humidity, etc.) you’re aiming for in your greenhouse will be compromised.\nDoes a greenhouse need a floor?\nA greenhouse does not need a floor, but one can help regulate the internal conditions of the greenhouse, like temperature and humidity."

Room dividers work in living rooms, bedrooms, and guest rooms to partition off or add zones to even the smallest spaces. The following projects are perfect for beginner DIYers and require simple tools and materials to craft these room dividers.\nUse bookshelves as dividers that double as storage, plants that form a living partition, rustic pallets, chicken wire, or refurbished bifold doors turned into folding screens. If you prefer a softer touch, there are ideas for hanging curtains, drapes, macrame works of art, and even reed fencing for a tropical look.\nRead on for these and other inspiring, creative DIY room divider ideas for your house.\nClick Play to See DIY Room Divider Ideas to Use in Your Home\n01\nof 26\nIkea Pax Door Room Divider\nIkea Hackers\nWhere there is a home decor need, there is an IKEA hack. Jules Yap, founder of the blog Ikea Hackers, offers a solution to create a bedroom space in a studio apartment. She divided the apartment into two parts with a sliding wall made of IKEA Pax wardrobe doors. These doors with frosted glass come large enough to stretch from ceiling to floor and slide effortlessly on tracks.\nIkea Pax Door Room Divider from Ikea Hackers\n02\nof 26\nIKEA Bookshelf Room Divider\nHomedit\nBookcases are popular as room dividers offering separation of space and additional storage. For this Ikea room divider hack, all you have to do is rotate a shelving unit so that it is perpendicular to the wall. Then, secure the unit, so it can't tip. Use solid restraints, such as metal L brackets attached to a wall stud and the top of the unit. Supplement this with screws driven through the side of the unit directly into the same stud.\nIkea Shelving Unit Room Divider Hack from Homedit\n03\nof 26\nTie-Back Curtains\nArbor & Co.\nDivide a bed alcove from the main living space in a studio apartment with affordable tie-back curtains. Keep them open to frame the entrance, or close them for privacy.\n04\nof 26\nWood Pallet Room Divider\nMy Friend Staci\nShocked that a Boston retailer was charging a fortune for a reclaimed wood room divider, Staci and her husband Doug made their own. After sourcing free wood pallets, they quickly put together this divider to separate one big room into an office/bedroom combination.\nThe divider does double duty as a kind of vertical scrapbook: Finish nails pounded into various spots act as hooks for binder clips to display mementos.\nWood Pallet Room Divider from My Friend Staci\nContinue to 5 of 26 below\n05\nof 26\nSalvaged Window Room Divider\nJones Design Company\nEmily at the craft blog Jones Design Company spent very little on this gorgeous salvaged antique window sash. After mounting it to the ceiling with a barn door track, she and her family had an instant DIY room divider. As Emily notes, she wanted to define the space yet \"keep things bright and open.\"\nHanging Window Room Divider from Jones Design Company\n06\nof 26\nSimple Jute Rope Room Divider\nThe Brick House\nMorgan Satterfield, who loves remodeling her midcentury modern home near Palm Springs, has a friend who offers upholstery classes in a giant warehouse, and that warehouse was just too big. Adding a divider near the door was the perfect way to soften this cavernous space.\nThis DIY room divider is simple and budget-friendly, costing between $50 to $100 to make.\nJute Rope Room Divider from The Brick House\n07\nof 26\nSalvaged Lath Room Divider\nThe Brooklyn Home Company\nIn traditional construction, lath was nailed to the studs and acted as a base for the wet plaster coating. However, these have been used to create a room divider in a living room.\nThe family-run collective The Brooklyn Home Company created a unique room divider out of the lath boards from a plaster-and-lath wall. This room divider wall pays homage to the roots of this old Brooklyn, New York duplex. The rough surface of the lath boards is a perfect complement to the smooth, light-colored walls.\n08\nof 26\nCurtain Room Divider\nGeorgia de Lotz / Unsplash\nWorking with a small living space? Instead of going with a pricey and permanent renovation project, try a simple and more temporary solution: curtains. These are a fantastic option for renters too.\nContinue to 9 of 26 below\n09\nof 26\nHigh-Gloss Bifold Doors\nIn My Own Style\nDiane at In My Own Style needed a divider between her office and living room. And thrift store bifold doors made the perfect inexpensive DIY solution, costing only $5.00.\nShe painted them a glossy white to match the rest of her home. Then, she attached them on one side to the wall with hinges and put a handle on the other side to easily pull the doors open and closed. \nHigh-Gloss Bifold Doors from In My Own Style\n10\nof 26\nMacrame Room Divider\nA Beautiful Mess\nMacrame doesn’t just make great wall art. It also can serve as a room divider with tons of texture. Rachel from A Beautiful Mess made a hanging macrame divider that was roughly 7 feet high to give her desk space some privacy. She even added some little air plants into the holes of the divider for a touch of greenery.\nMacrame Room Divider from A Beautiful Mess\n11\nof 26\nBarn Door Room Divider\nAmber Interior Design\nIf you like the farmhouse style, a barn door room divider might be just what your space needs. Many barn door kits should suit most spaces. But Amber from Amber Interior Design made her own barn door room divider, tailored to create a walk-in closet space.\nBarn Door Room Divider from Amber Interior Design\n12\nof 26\nVertical Garden Room Divider\nGetty Images\nVertical gardens help to save space and are especially ideal for plant lovers in small homes. A DIY room divider idea you can build comes from Urban Gardens and is super simple to put together. It uses roughly 70-inch tall Ikea plant stands placed next to one another with three plants per stand. These planters are free-standing, so they can be moved around as needed.\nContinue to 13 of 26 below\n13\nof 26\nHanging Divider\nMaking It Lovely\nNicole from Making It Lovely wanted a bit of separation on her front porch. So she created a visually appealing hanging divider out of painted pieces of hardboard, wooden dowels, s-hooks, and chains. She first mapped out the pattern she wanted for her boards, cut them to size, and then attached them with the hooks. You can easily customize this divider using different colors and shapes for the wood.  \nHanging Divider from Making It Lovely\n14\nof 26\nDIY Tropical Room Divider\nVery Irie\nIf your design style embraces the natural vibe of the tropics, consider reed fencing as a room divider material. This DIY divider idea from Very Irie uses inexpensive fencing trimmed with wood and hung from the ceiling. It’s quick and easy to put together, yet it has a luxurious, spa-like feel. \nDIY Tropical Divider from Very Irie\n15\nof 26\nDIY Geometric Fretwork Screen\nRemodelaholic\nIf you’re looking for a divider that creates some separation while maintaining airiness in a space, look no further than this DIY fretwork screen from Remodelaholic. Similar screens can sell for hundreds of dollars, but this DIY design uses just a few inexpensive materials—namely wood, hinges, and nails. This project requires careful measurements to get the fretwork just right, but otherwise, it comes together easily.\nDIY Geometric Fretwork Screen from Remodelaholic\n16\nof 26\nDIY Multifunctional Room Divider\nEffortless Style Interiors\nThis DIY room divider from Effortless Style Interiors is perfect for partitioning off an office space. On one side, the freestanding wood trifold divider is padded and upholstered. The other side is painted in chalkboard paint, making it the perfect spot to jot down notes as you work. You can even use the upholstered side as a headboard when you don’t need the divider.\nDIY Multifunctional Room Divider from Effortless Style Interiors\nContinue to 17 of 26 below\n17\nof 26\nBeaded Curtain DIY Room Divider\nDesign Love Fest \nThis room divider idea from Design Love Fest isn’t meant so much for privacy as it is to add some fun and visual separation to a space. It’s a DIY room divider nod to the retro beaded curtains of the 1960s and 1970s. It uses 2-inch styrofoam balls as the “beads” hung on natural cotton cord. You can make as many strands as you like to fit your space. \nBeaded Curtain DIY from Design Love Fest\n18\nof 26\nHanging Succulent Garden\nSkinny La Mix\nConsider hanging plants to create separation in a room without taking up any floor space. Succulents are a great option because they stay fairly small, so you can hang lots of little pots to form a room divider. This DIY room divider idea from Skinny LaMinx hangs several potted succulents in a row using macrame plant hangers. It creates designated spaces and visual interest while still maintaining an airy, natural vibe.\nHanging Succulent Garden from Skinny LaMinx\n19\nof 26\nPony Wall Divider\nin4mal / Getty Images\nBuilding a pony wall is simpler than it looks.

So she punched out the flimsy pressboard inserts in the divider, retaining the wood frame. Shabby chic and elegant country are her preferred styles, so she purchased chicken wire and stapled it to each of the three sections. After adding curios and photos, she now has a personalized DIY room divider that separates her kitchen from the dining room.\nChicken Wire Divider from Home Road\n24\nof 26\nCoiled Wire Fabric Divider\nCascade Coil\nThis room divider looks like fabric—except it isn't. Instead, this coiled wire mesh drapes and hangs just like fabric. Oregon's Cascade Coil made this room divider for a Hyatt Hotel. However, you can purchase metal coil products directly from the company and DIY a custom room divider for your space.\nCoiled Wire Fabric Divider from Cascade Coil\nContinue to 25 of 26 below\n25\nof 26\nAdjustable Fabric Room Divider\nFresh Crush\nJennifer Eckert of the design blog Fresh Crush dreamed up this fabric-covered room divider idea that's inexpensive and easy to create. The connectors attached to the ceiling allow for easy vertical adjustment. The fabric is stretched over artist canvases, each measuring 30 by 50 inches.\n26\nof 26\nFabric Screen Rack\nCheap Office / Instructables\nThere's no need to spend a lot of money on a DIY room divider. For an inexpensive room divider that’s more functional than stylish, you can’t beat this DIY idea from Instructables. It makes a 5-foot-by-5-foot divider out of PVC tubing and canvas for just $25. The divider offers privacy but still doesn’t feel too bulky in a space. And if you want to add some design flair, you always can decorate the canvas. \nCheap Room Divider from Cheap Office / Instructables\nFAQ\nWhat is the cheapest way to divide a room?\nOne of the cheapest ways to divide a room is to simply hang floor-to-ceiling curtains.\nHow do you make a homemade room divider?\nYou can make a homemade room divider using various materials, such as curtains, pipes, rope, chicken wire, and more.\nWhat is the easiest way to divide a room?\nThe easiest and most simple method for dividing a room is to use curtains. Not only are curtains cost-effective, but they are also versatile, easy to install, and not permanent. Curtains also allow you to open and close up your space as desired.\nDoes splitting a room into two add value?\nWhether you opt for a DIY room divider or a full renovation, dividing a room into two won't add much value to your house as it does not increase the square footage. However, it can add functionality for your needs."

IKEA is providing a major refresh to over forty of their favorite products, from designer-made furniture to IKEA classics that were selling out in the store’s 1950s catalogs. \nThe updated Nytillverkad collection focuses on including bold, bright colors to old pieces to add a little more joy and excitement to the home. Each of the products in the collection is available in multiple brand-new colors, providing a light update to old classics without changing their original design too much.\nIKEA also provides a little bit of background and history on each of the original designs from the collection, many of which were created (and even revamped) by popular designers at the time of their creation.\nIKEA\nIKEA hand-picked a few favorites from the collection to look out for while you browse, and we've added in a few more reimagined classics you'll definitely want to add to your home decor. From decorative pieces to statement furniture, there's no better way to add a pop of color and timeless decor to your home this spring season.\nThe collection includes classic prints like the reimagined STRECKFLY print, redesigned in a modern black-and-white color scheme, or the ÄNGSFIBBLA cushion cover, which was first released in 1971 and is now getting several vibrant updates for this year.\nIKEA\nThere’s also plenty of updated seating available in IKEA’s vintage catalog, like the 1967 IKEA swivel armchair—which now features an extra leg for additional stability.\nThe SOTENÄS armchair—a cushy, modern statement chair—comes in a vibrant canary yellow and is guaranteed to impress even your pickiest houseguests. \nIKEA\nIKEA also renamed its now-modern BAGGBODA table, which is available in two bright, airy colors: lemon yellow and white. Another 1956 IKEA side table comes in four new bold colors.\nOf course, you’ll need tabletop accessories—the 1995 designer OPTIMUM vase was originally designed by Ehlén Johansson, who took the opportunity to give it a stylish 2024 refresh. There are even playful modern candle holders for display in the vintage collection, all of which come in multiple colors, of course.\nIKEA\nThe collection wouldn't be complete without a rug that can tie any space together, of course. Straight from the 1950s comes the vibrant BULLEREMSA rug, perfect for spaces focused on dopamine decor (or anyone looking to add a fresh pop of color to their floor). \nIf you’re interested in shopping the updated collection, all of the reimagined products are available on IKEA’s official website right now—and they're here for a limited time only, so don't hesitate to order your favorites. You’ll also be able to find the collection in IKEA stores—to see what products are available near you, you can simply shop by store on IKEA’s website before heading in yourself. \nAll of the original Nytillverkad products are available for viewing in the IKEA museum, which features a catalog of old IKEA products to look back on."

  "articleText": "HOME DESIGN & DECORATING DECORATING WALLS & PAINT\nIs It a Good Idea to Paint Your Interior Doors Black?\nWhat to know before you start painting\nBy TESSA COOPER\nPublished on 02/10/24\nHouse 9 Interiors\nBlack is such a versatile color. Depending on what you pair it with, it can lend a sleek and modern or moody and cozy flair to a room. While dousing your walls in a layer of black paint can feel like a big commitment and bold choice, painting your interior doors black is a more easily reversed decision that achieves the same effect in a more subtle way.\nBut before you pick up that roller, here's what to know about painting interior doors black.\n1.\nSelect Room Shape\nRectangle\nSquare\nCustom\n2.\nCalculate Square Footage\n?\nWall 1\nWall 2\nAdd Wall\nCeiling Paint\n?\nCalculate\nSubtract windows and doors\n?\nWindows\nDoors\nEmbed This Tool\nIs Painting Interior Doors Black a Good Idea?\nPainting interior doors black is typically a good idea if it's a well-thought-out idea. In the right space, black doors can add contrast and personality, but it may not be a good idea for smaller spaces that do not receive very much natural light.\nFor starters, you should consider how the color black will look next to your current wall color and other furniture. Think of this design choice in relation to the whole room, not just the door. Before purchasing all of your paint, you should always paint a swatch and examine how the paint looks in different lighting situations.\nIf your interior doors are natural wood, you're working with a bit more risk since it will take paint stripper, sanding, and re-staining to restore the doors to their unaltered state. With already-painted doors, you've got less to lose. Just keep in mind that it will take several layers of primer to paint over a black door, so you're looking at a time commitment either way.\nHana's Happy Home\nYou Can Paint Just One Side\nYou can definitely just opt to paint one side of the door black. When working with a statement color, there's no strict design rule on whether you should paint one side of the door or both. If you do not want the door to be black on the side that primarily shows in the adjacent room, you can paint that side a more traditional color like white.\nKnow When to Match the Doors\nIf your room contains several matching doors, such as a bathroom door, closet door, and main door, consider painting all of them black for a sense of cohesion. Or, if the room contains a unique door, such as a sliding door or pair of French doors, you can highlight the focal point and reserve the color black for just this feature.\n@alannadunn / Instagram\nExperiment with Different Hardware\nBlack doors look great with any color hardware. Of course, it might be your initial instinct to go with black hardware on a black door. While this is always a classic choice, consider adding some contrast and trying out brass door knobs and hinges for a unique yet timeless look.\nOpt for a Durable Finish\nAlways select a strong finish with a little bit of shine for any color door, black doors included. Semi-gloss is an ideal option because it contains just a small amount of sheen, but it's more durable than eggshell or flat paint. High-gloss black paint can make a nice statement on a door, but keep in mind that high-gloss paint shows more imperfections.\nDesign by Nyla Free Designs Inc. / Photo by Phil Crozier\nConsider the Trim\nBlack doors look great with white or black trim. If you want to go the traditional route, white is a safe bet. To add some drama and draw even more attention to the black door, paint the trim black.\n3 Paint Colors to Try for Painting the Interior of Doors Black\nWhen selecting paint samples to swatch, it's always a good idea to test out ones with a little undertone and light reflectance value (LRV) variance. Undertones are the other colors present in the black, such as cool tones like blue or warmer tones like brown. LRV refers to how much light a paint reflects. A pitch black surface will have a light reflectance value of 0.\nHere are three classic options for a jumping-off point.\nTri Corn Black by Sherwin Williams is a true black, which means there aren't any undertones present. This neutral has an LRV of 2.45.\nBlack Jack by Benjamin Moore is a black paint with slightly cool undertones. Its LRV is 6.04, so it's not quite as dark as Tri Corn Black.\nBlack Fox by Sherwin Williams shows off warm brown undertones, so it's a good option for rooms with wood accents. It has an LRV of 7.05, making it almost read a little charcoal.\n@verandaestatehomes / Instagram\nSubtract windows and doors\n?\nWindows\nDoors\nSubtract windows and doors\n?\nWindows\nDoors\nFAQ\nShould the door knob on a black door also be black?\nBlack door knobs on a black door can create a sleek monochromatic moment, which is great if your style leads more modern. If you prefer a more antique look, brass door knobs contrast especially well on black doors.\nHow do you choose a black paint color for an interior door?\nTo choose a black paint color for an interior door, first consider whether you want a true black or black with slightly cool or warm undertones. Then, decide whether you want a pitch-black hue or one with a little bit of light reflectance. Once you know the look you're going for, you can choose paint accordingly for a swatch test and choose your favorite.\nWhen should you not paint the insides of your doors black?\nIf you're working with a small room with a lack of natural light, the color black can make the space feel more petite. However, this isn't necessarily a bad thing if you're going for more of a cozy feel."

  "articleText": "HOME DESIGN & DECORATING ROOM DESIGN ENTRYWAYS & MUDROOMS\nEvery Staircase Decorating Idea We Loved This Year, From Runners to Wainscoting\nBy SHAGUN KHARE\nPublished on 11/07/24\nBritt Design Studio\nStaircases are one of those oft-neglected parts of the home when it comes to design. However, they take up a significant amount of space and are openly on display. Ergo, everyone can see them—and they’re hard to ignore.\nIt’s only right, then, that staircases get their due attention and care. After all, there are so many features you can get creative with—from the balusters and lighting to the walls and stairs themselves.\nThink: painted stair risers, gallery wall displays, spiral staircases, and so much more. Not sure where to start? Here are 32 staircase decorating ideas for your inspiration.\nWant more design inspiration? Sign up for our free daily newsletter for the latest decor ideas, designer tips, and more!\n01\nof 32\nChoose Oaky Accents\nAmy Leferink at Interior Impressions\nThe wood handrails of this staircase match the tops of the stairs themselves, lending an earthy, sleek look. Further contemporary furnishings alongside play into the theme.\n02\nof 32\nAdd Wainscoting\nBecca Interiors\nGeometric wainscoting on the outside of this staircase gives it depth and texture. An inky black handrail offers moody juxtaposition against the white balusters—a perfect mix of traditional and modern.\n03\nof 32\nPlace Windows in the Landings\nBlakely Interior Design / Photo by Andrea Pietrangeli\nBig, airy windows pour light into the midway landing of this staircase, making it feel expansive and grand. A chandelier adds to the effect, while wainscoting adds depth. Carpeted stairs soften the look.\n04\nof 32\nUse a Patterned Runner\nBlakely Interior Design / Photo by Andrea Pietrangeli\nHave a penchant for pattern? A staircase is the perfect place to infuse character. This B&W space features repeating diamond patterns on the runner, which overlays white and oak stairs.\nContinue to 5 of 32 below\n05\nof 32\nAdd a Curved Handrail\nBritt Design Studio\nA curved handrail brings subtle elegance to this staircase, emphasized by the soft, upholstered stairs. The deep mahogany hue of the railings plays off the hardwood floors, while a circular inky table makes a beautiful impression at the entrance.\n06\nof 32\nEmphasize Landing Heights\nBritt Design Studio\nIf your home has high ceilings, a landing is the perfect place to emphasize that height. This one, for instance, is outfitted with a bench, floor-to-ceiling windows, and artwork spanning the full length of the walls—making it feel expansive.\n07\nof 32\nAdd a Mudroom Under the Stairs\nCalimia Home\nIf your stairs create a nook near the entrance, it's the perfect place to tuck a mudroom. This one is swathed in slate blue to match the carpeting on the stairs, and also features woodsy accents to reflect the railing.\n08\nof 32\nTile Your Stair Risers\nCalimia Home\nMoroccan-style tiles decorate the stair risers in this space, featuring a delicate gray and black pattern. Each stair is topped with oaky hardwood for contrast.\nContinue to 9 of 32 below\n09\nof 32\nAdd Embellished Balusters\nCalimia Home\nThese stairs also feature tiles, though on both the risers and the steps—playing on Mediterranean design. The balusters are set in charcoal black to be cohesive with the steps, and also feature asymmetrical embellishments on certain poles for added elegance.\n10\nof 32\nTry Marble Steps\nCalimia Home\nPrefer a more luxurious look? Marble always fits the bill. This semi-spiral staircase is a breath of fresh air, with a large arched window, ornate balusters, and marble tiling—all washed in white.\n11\nof 32\nCenter With Statement Lighting\nCharbonneau Interiors\nThis staircase also features a regal look, thanks to a spiral design, deep mahogany wood, and unique stair risers. Glassy lighting makes a statement at the top, anchoring the staircase.\n12\nof 32\nAdd Artistic Stair Risers\nCharbonneau Interiors\nMarbled stair risers offer a striking effect. This staircase, in particular, hones in on contemporary style, with abstract artwork at the landing and pale wood steps.\nContinue to 13 of 32 below\n13\nof 32\nCreate Cohesion\nCharlie Interior Design\nFloating stairs can be polarizing—some love it while others prefer other styles. One thing that stays true, though, is that they are ideal for minimalist and more organic spaces. The gap in between stairs allows for a breezy, airy feel.\n14\nof 32\nAlternate Stair Riser Patterns\nChristopher Lee Foto\nFor a more playful style, alternate the patterns on each of your stair risers. This staircase, for instance, features a wide variety—from spots to triangles, curves, and more—making a subtle statement.\n15\nof 32\nGo Minimal\nChristopher Lee Foto\nThis airy space features all white stairs, with a slight off-white border on each of the steps for added depth. The thin, wiry balusters hone in on the breezy effect, with cushions and a tree at the bottom of the stairs providing a pop of color.\n16\nof 32\nCreate a Cabin Effect\nDesign by Emily Henderson Design / Photo by Sara Ligorria-Tramp\nSwath your staircase in wood to create a cabin-like feel. This space plays into the woodsiness of the ceilings and floors by opting for all-wood stairs. Inky iron balusters add slight contrast.\nContinue to 17 of 32 below\n17\nof 32\nAdd a Console Table to Semi-Spiral Stairs\nBritt Design Studio\nA curved staircase is an ideal way to bring in movement to a space. This one is outfitted with carpeted, patterned stairs that add visual interest, as well as wall paneling from the top floor to the bottom. The console table added nearby also gives a more rigid contrast to an otherwise fluid space.\n18\nof 32\nUse a Sconce in the Landing\nDesigned by Emily Henderson Design / Photo by Sara Tramp\nLandings are a great spot to bring in the design chops for a staircase. This one features wainscoting, as well as a glass and gold pendant, infusing a touch of refinement to the area.\n19\nof 32\nEmbrace a White and Wood Combo\nHannah Tyler Interior Design\nWhite and wood is a design color combination made in heaven. Here, oaky floors are used on the steps, while white is used on the risers to create contrast.\n20\nof 32\nUse Contrasting Materials\nErin Williamson Design\nIf your space features lots of one material—in this case, wood—it's always smart to balance it out with opposing textures. This staircase does it with metal balusters and a glass, orby light fixture.\nContinue to 21 of 32 below\n21\nof 32\nReflect Features in a Mirror\nJessica Nelson Design\nIf your staircase has a unique pattern or shape, a mirror is the perfect way to emphasize that feature. This staircase has a zigzag shape that looks striking from the outside, so a mirror is placed at the entrance to highlight it.\n22\nof 32\nKeep it Traditional\nJessica Nelson Design\nA pretty display is tucked into the arch of the staircase, decorated with colorful artwork and a curved table. The contemporary look is balanced out with more traditional balusters and hues in the staircase itself.\n23\nof 32\nPunctuate With Bold Newel Posts\nJK Interior Living\nNewel posts are the larger columns placed intermittently between balusters, and are a great way to bring in depth. Here, bold stocky newel posts set the tone for this elegant staircase.\n24\nof 32\nAdd Artwork Leading Upwards\nJLA Designs\nIt's always captivating to place artwork along a staircase, especially if it can lead upwards as is done here.\nVarious sized pieces resembling the tops of flowers are placed diagonally up the wall to emphasize the shape of the staircase.\nContinue to 25 of 32 below\n25\nof 32\nBreak Up Pattern With Solid Hues\nJLA Designs\nIf you're opting for a patterned runner along your stairs, it's helpful to break it up with more clean, solid hues. Here, wood tones and crisp white walls do the trick.\n26\nof 32\nCenter the Spiral\nJLA Designs\nWith a spiral staircase, you want to emphasize the center to showcase the beauty of it. Here, a drippy pendant at the top and a round table at the bottom draw the eyes to the center of the spiral, exaggerating its drama.\n27\nof 32\nInfuse Whimsical Touches\nJLA Designs\nLighten up contemporary staircases with whimsy touches. A spiral, teardrop-motif chandelier and bright florals at the entrance allow for this effect here.\n28\nof 32\nCreate an Accent Wall\nKate Marker Interiors\nIf your stairs are set against a wall, it's a great opportunity to add in some personality by accenting it. Here, exposed brick offers a warm, rustic addition to the space.\nContinue to 29 of 32 below\n29\nof 32\nLight Up at Foot-Level\nKate Marker Interiors\nAs the sun sets, it's important that staircases are properly lit. Especially in the case of floating stairs, foot-level lighting is helpful—achieved with brass sconces here.\n30\nof 32\nPlay Off an Existing Motif\nKate Marker Interiors\nIf you have a pattern or motif already in a space adjacent to your staircase, you can always take inspiration from it to create cohesion. Here, stripes from the chairs are emulated in the stair runner.\n31\nof 32\nIncorporate Silver Accents\nKate Marker Interiors\nIt's common to opt for brass accents, but silver makes a statement just as well—and pairs especially well with cool tones. The hue is present in the handrail (note that it's attached to the wall rather than balusters!) as well as a mirror at the entrance.\n32\nof 32\nConnect Balusters Directly to Stairs\nLaura Brophy Interiors\nThis modern staircase is simple yet striking. The highlight? It cleverly connects the balusters to the stairs themselves—rather than a lower railing—making it feel as if they are hanging on a thread and emphasizing clean lines,"

From woven baskets to hanging shoe bags, these toy storage ideas may just inspire your kid to clean up the playroom—or at the very least, they'll be able to find their toys without asking you.\nHere are 33 smart toy storage ideas to help keep your home tidy.\nThe Spruce / Jacob Fox\nTips for Toy Organizing\nThere are various strategies for keeping toys organized.

  "articleText": "If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation.\nHOME NEWS BRANDS & COLLECTIONS\nIKEA’s MITTZON Collection Features Office Furniture With Function and Style in Mind\nBy SOPHIA BEAMS\nUpdated on 03/21/24\nIKEA\nOver the past few years, IKEA has been looking at office configurations and wondering how they can be reworked. It’s no secret that most modern offices leave a lot to be desired, both in terms of aesthetics and often practicality too.\nThis is the main idea behind the MITTZON collection; a flexible, ergonomic, and simple line of furniture that will completely transform any office space—whether you’re sharing it with others or working alone.\nIKEA\n“With MITTZON, our goal was to develop an office system that can establish the foundation for a truly flexible, comfortable, and healthy environment, where everyone can find a suitable place to work, feel motivated and inspired,” says Philip Dilé, Product Design Developer at IKEA of Sweden AB, in an official statement from IKEA.\nThe pieces in the MITTZON collection are designed to be multi-use and extremely adjustable. Hybrid office spaces are often difficult to configure with employees transitioning in and out of the office; this means that each piece in the MITTZON collection is easy to move and comes with multiple ways to set it up and store it.\nThe soothing green ergonomic MITTZON desks, for example, can transition from sitting to standing desks, attach to one another to form a large conference table, roll around on wheels, and can even flip sideways for easy storage when not in use. \nIKEA\nIKEA also highlights employee focus with the MITTZON collection. There are a variety of options for soundproof privacy screens (which are also customizable), and all of them are designed to block out as much noise as possible from surrounding cubicles—a much more pleasant way to create an open office layout. Plus, each piece is designed with calm, minimalist colors and natural wood tones of the collection—relaxing to both the eye and the mind.\n“We worked with experts in the field to consider not only the physical body but also what affects the senses, and therefore focus and wellbeing, in an office environment, and we’ve incorporated those findings into the development of MITTZON,” adds Dilé in an IKEA statement.\nThe other bonus of the MITTZON collection is that many pieces will work for at-home use—especially if you’re looking to make a small home office more ergonomic, too.\nIKEA offers a variety of size options for many of their pieces, so you’ll be able to find furniture that fits in any space. Whether you’re looking for moveable shelving or want a chair that’s built for long periods of use, the MITTZON collection has you covered.\nIKEA\nEvery item in the collection comes with a ten-year guarantee. IKEA knows how important it is that office furniture doesn’t need to be constantly replaced—the retailer even made many of the MITTZON pieces modular, so an office can slowly upgrade them over time as the needs of the space change. \nThe collection will feature a total of 85 products and will be released in April 2024."

The shelves cover the wall from side to side and top to bottom, creating the illusion of inset shelves.\nBuilt-in bookshelves require a lot of lumber, but one way to save on materials is to use the wall behind them as the backing board. Paint the wall and the shelves the same color to complete the illusion.\nCan built-in bookshelves increase home value?\nIt's debatable whether built-in bookshelves increase home value. Functional built-ins installed in kitchens and bathrooms add some value, as long as they are well-built and made with quality materials.\nSome homebuyers may view built-in bookshelves as a plus. In contrast, others may view them as a distinct negative—especially if they need to factor removal and disposal into their offering price."

A simple cloth draped over the structure can ensure some extra privacy without having to break the bank.\n10 DIY Privacy Screen Plans\n03\nof 27\nChannel Palm Beach Style\nDesign by Caitlin Higgins for EHD / Photo by Sara Liggoria-Tramp\nCaitlin Higgins wasn't a massive fan of her tiny outdoor space, so she decided to revamp it—and the results are stunning. She added a set of pinstripe curtains that provide just the right amount of lighting—not too sheer, but not blackout either.\nThe reflective brass table adds a layer of elegance, while the set of black chairs helps ground the space and adds some serious contrast.\n04\nof 27\nAccent With Plants\n@tanjasovulj / Instagram\nTanja Sovulj knows how to strategically place plants in her balcony space. The hanging plant boxes on the wrought iron fence, small potted plants on the table and in the corner, and a simple hanging structure that looks stylish and functional to showcase even more greenery.\nContinue to 5 of 27 below\n05\nof 27\nAdd a Planter Wall\n@coffee_home_bea / Instagram\nA planter wall sets the tone for this lovely balcony by Coffee Home Bea. Vibrant florals add a festive touch. Wicker furniture and green astroturf create a decorative haven to retreat to when you want to unwind and relax.\n06\nof 27\nErect a Privacy Screen\n@_allezeitderwelt_ / Instagram\nWho doesn't love simple projects that add function and style to spaces? Case in point: this super affordable privacy screen idea by Yeri at Allezeitderwelt.\nA simple addition of a half-privacy screen made of thin bamboo strands still allows for a view without giving onlookers a full view of the space. The cozy fabric palette on the ground is nestled in the perfect spot for some relaxation in a refreshing atmosphere.\n07\nof 27\nAdd Style and Function\n@vidyaamberkerinteriors / Instagram\nIt's important to incorporate options that are both stylish and functional—like these plant stands on this balcony from Vidya Amberker Interiors. The various heights allow all the different plants to be seen, and it adds a decorative aspect as opposed to solely keeping the plants on the ground.\n08\nof 27\nChannel Parisian Style\nDesign by Jessica Bunge for EHD / Photo by Sara Liggoria-Tramp\nJessica Bunge from Emily Henderson Design took her extremely narrow balcony and turned it into a Parisian-style dream. The alternating deck tiles from IKEA were the result of a DIY project she took on to turn a concrete floor into something much more aesthetic.\nThe vintage dining set was initially a set of four that she split with a friend—also known as friendship furniture. This concept works remarkably well for small apartment balconies that don't have the space to accommodate a larger number of chairs.\nContinue to 9 of 27 below\n09\nof 27\nTry an Egg-Shaped Chair\n@kodikkaasti / Instagram\nRather than sticking with an average set of chairs, it doesn't hurt to add in something a bit more whimsical—like an egg-shaped chair. This chair takes up the perfect amount of space—without being too overwhelming— on this balcony from Kodikkaasti. The stacked flower baskets in the corner and the paper lantern above add a stunning decorative element that ties things together.\n10\nof 27\nThrift and Repurpose\n@forgottencharmthrift / Instagram\nAdriana from Forgotten Charm Thrift on Instagram found a wood pallet sectional frame on the side of the road and repurposed it for her balcony. She knew she would need some outdoor cushions to make this a viable seating option, so she turned to Etsy and ordered cushions that were specifically made to fit wood pallets, adding in some thrifted pillows.\n11\nof 27\nMake It an Extension\n@myhousemydecor10 / Instagram\nTo create your perfect balcony with a limited footprint, consider treating the balcony like an extension of your home. Opening up the doors and windows—like My House My Decor 10 did here—and keeping a similar theme between rooms can help make a smaller balcony feel more expansive.\n12\nof 27\nA Little Urban Jungle\n@gomes_höeppner_balkon / Instagram\nIndulge your green thumb by turning your balcony into a little urban jungle. This lovely outdoor space from F.R. Gomes-Hoppner is covered with beautiful greenery and seasonal flowers. Covering the railing are flower boxes.\nThe tiny accent table and chair is a perfect space for one, overlooking the view of the city. The large umbrella brings the perfect amount of shade to protect from the sun's harsh rays.\nContinue to 13 of 27 below\n13\nof 27\nMake It Pet-Friendly\n@sad.fat.cat / Instagram\nGot a pet? Then take note of this balcony setup from Sad Fat Cat on Instagram on how to turn your balcony into a pet-friendly space. The typical white fence wouldn't be quite enough to keep your furry friend inside, but adding a surround of thin wire mesh can do this trick.\nTo keep things from feeling too contained, use that added mesh to help support more decor—like these whimsical and colorful paper lanterns of various shapes and sizes.\n14\nof 27\nAdd Personal Touches\n@mishys_arrtsy_home / Instagram\nWhen designing a balcony, naturally there will be common factors between your and others' spaces—a table and chairs, plants, and lighting. However, you shouldn't feel as though you have to make a carbon copy of other spaces to have a stylish balcony—it should reflect some of your personal taste as well.\nThis balcony from Mishy's Arrtsy Home is a great example. The small table is draped with a vintage-style tablecloth, and there are plenty of plants and string lights for atmosphere. The wall is styled with colorful decorative plates, a mirror, and other small decor items that she hand-picked herself to create an eclectic, tasteful space.\n15\nof 27\nKeep Things Simple\nDesign by Caitlin Higgins for EHD / Photograph by Sara Ligorria-Tramp\nWhen decorating a space, sometimes the best results can come from keeping things simple. This portion of Caitlin Higgin's balcony is absolutely charming. A two-seat rattan bench she found online is covered with a comfy white cushion and decorative pillows for personality.\n16\nof 27\nWork With a Color Scheme\nDazey Den\nTrying to discover how to decorate any space—particularly smaller ones—can start by figuring out a color scheme to work with.\nThis peachy dream from Dazey Den uses the pinkish hue on the surrounding fence, as well as the table and chairs. Small pops of blue on the table create a nice contrast that is welcoming and vibrant.\nContinue to 17 of 27 below\n17\nof 27\nTile the Floor\n@diydoctorat49 / Instagram\nIf you are looking for a permanent way to cover up an unattractive balcony floor, consider tile suited for outdoor use. Sophia of DIY Doctorat 49 realized the previous owner of her place had used indoor tiles on the outdoor balcony—so she decided to give the terrace a refresh with new, outdoor tiles.\nThe blue and white geometric pattern add a striking pop to the whole space, proving how much tile can truly make a difference.\n18\nof 27\nMake It Bold and Bright\nDazey Den\nWorking with a small balcony doesn't mean you can't go all out with color. This space from Dazey Den is all about incorporating pink. The colors along with the large cactus and small surrounding succulents make this a playful space to hang out and entertain.\n19\nof 27\nMake It Cozy\n@takinada / Instagram\nWhoever says seating has to be strictly table and chairs on a balcony space clearly isn't aware of the comfort of a lounge space. This balcony from Takinada has the perfect cozy setup—ideal for relaxation and overlooking the greenery surrounding the home.\n20\nof 27\nAdd Color and Patterns\n@studioenass / Instagram\nNeutral not your thing? Don't worry—it's not a requirement for your balcony. Try experimenting with color, texture, and patterns, like this stylish space designed by Studio Enass. The primary color scheme comes into full effect here, and along with the patterned tiles and decorative prints on the pillows, the space is full of life and energy.\nContinue to 21 of 27 below\n21\nof 27\nReuse What You Have\n@tarzmeselesi / Instagram\nYou might be surprised by what items you have available that can be repurposed into something else. Take this balcony by Tarzmeselesi: a set of wooden crates are propped up on the ends, covered with a cushion, and voilà. Perfect stools to sit at the bar and take in the views of the city. As a bonus, the crate can also serve as extra storage.\n22\nof 27\nMake It Durable\n@tanjasolvulj / Instagram\nIf you live in a small apartment or house, chances are you do not have room to store balcony furniture during the fall and winter months. The good news is, some types of outdoor furniture can stay outside all year. Here are a few things to keep in mind when shopping for weatherproof pieces:\nWood: Outdoor furniture made of woods like teak, cedar, or redwood is naturally rot-resistant. Treating items made from these materials with waterproof sealer will enhance their weather-resistant properties and prevent graying of the wood.\nSynthetic wicker: Faux wicker is typically made with weatherproof polypropylene, a type of plastic that stands up to moisture and extreme temperatures.\nFurniture covers: When you are not using your balcony, water-repellent covers will help to protect your outdoor furniture year-round.\nAdditionally, choosing furniture that can fold away when not in use can help with added protection—as well as space. This balcony from Tanja Solvulj showcases plenty of wooden features that can hold under weather—but the foldable table is the perfect size for easy access, and can be put away when needed.\n23\nof 27\nTry a Balcony Bar\n@ivy.paysagiste / Instagram\nWhen there is no room to spare for a table in your super tiny outdoor space, a shelf that you can attach to a balcony railing—often referred to as a balcony bar—can be a handy feature.\nThis balcony by Ivy Paysagiste shows how effortlessly it fits into the balcony scene—and can be used to support food and beverages, or even a laptop if you want to work outside.\n24\nof 27\nInstall an Awning\nDazey Den\nThis tropical chic apartment balcony awning from Dazey Den is both practical and decorative, making the space more comfortable on scorching days while simultaneously complementing the balcony's color scheme and framing the lush green outdoor view.\nContinue to 25 of 27 below\n25\nof 27\nLet It Flow\nMaite Granda\nInterior designer Maite Granda treated this Florida condo balcony like an extension of the interior, with a pale palette and woven upholstered furniture that creates a seamless flow between indoors and out and keeps the focus on the wide open views.\n26\nof 27\nAdd Slipcovered Seating\nFantastic Frank\nDecorate a small balcony with a compact daybed covered in simple natural linens for a Scandi-inspired look. This space from Fantastic Frank includes an outdoor rug and a mini potted herb garden.\n27\nof 27\nAdd Bonus Seating\nJohn McClain Design / Photo by Zeke Ruelas\nIf you love to entertain, pack your small balcony with as much seating as it will accommodate. John McClain Design managed to fit two cozy seating areas on this duplex balcony that are outfitted with modern furniture and a fire pit.\nHow do you make an apartment balcony look good?\nElevate the decor of your apartment balcony by outfitting it with stylish furniture that is scaled to fit the space, such as a small bistro table and a pair of chairs or a DIY banquette made from pallet wood. You can decorate your apartment balcony with plants, a small outdoor runner-style rug, string lights, or a DIY privacy screen. \n17 Ways to Turn Your Tiny Balcony Into an Irresistible Retreat"

  "articleText": "GARDENING LANDSCAPING LAWN CARE\nCan You Really Mow Wet Grass? 8 Reasons Why It Isn't a Good Idea\nBy DAVID BEAULIEU\nPublished on 04/05/24\nThe Spruce / Steven Merkel\nDuring a busy week, trying to find the right time to mow the lawn can be a challenge, especially if the grass is wet. It's not recommended to mow wet grass, and it's better to hold off until it's fully dry.\nThere are several reasons you shouldn't mow wet grass, from safety concerns to mower care to the health and appearance of your lawn.\nRead on to learn more about why you shouldn't mow wet grass, including some tips for mowing wet grass if you really have to do it.\nCan You Mow Wet Grass?\nGenerally, you shouldn't mow wet grass, as it could clog your mower, leave behind unsightly clumps in your lawn, or put you at risk of electric shock if using an electric mower.\nThink about it: water weighs down each blade of grass, so your mower is going to roll over the top and only cut taller blades, leaving an uneven finish.\nWe round up 8 additional reasons to avoid doing this task in the rain or right after—you'll be grateful you waited.\n01\nof 08\nRisk of Slipping\nImage by Chris Winsor / Getty Images\nSafety is always the first consideration, and mowing the lawn when it is wet increases the chances of slipping on a wet surface (this chance increases if you have to mow on a slope).\nAlthough today's mowers have safety features that make it less likely that your body is going to come into contact with the blade, you still want to avoid any accidents.\n02\nof 08\nRisk of Electric Shock\nThe Spruce / Almar Creative\nElectricity and water don't mix. If you have an electric mower, using it on wet grass could put you at risk for electric shock. It's best to avoid using any electric mower when it's damp out.\n03\nof 08\nDamage to Your Mower\nowngarden / Getty Images\nWhen you mow the grass when it is wet, clumps can build up around the blade, blocking the blade from spinning properly. The harder it is for your mower's blade to spin, the greater the pressure you are putting on the engine. This can result in your lawn mower smoking because the engine is being overworked.\nNor is your mower so air-tight that moisture can't find its way into the fuel tank, which will eventually stop your machine from running properly.\n04\nof 08\nFungal Diseases Spread\nThe Spruce / K. Dave\nFungal diseases such as brown patch thrive under wet conditions. When mowing wet grass, you are transporting fungi (on your mower blade and wheels) throughout your lawn. Each time you cut a blade of grass, you are opening up a wound that fungi are able to invade. That's one reason why mowing wet grass is detrimental to lawn health.\nContinue to 5 of 8 below\n05\nof 08\nCreating Ruts in the Lawn\nVstock / Getty Images\nYour mower's wheels will sink into soil that is waterlogged. The result will be wheel ruts. These ruts are a safety hazard, compact the soil (which could lead to draining issues), and it looks unsightly.\n06\nof 08\nUnsightly Grass Clumps Will Be Left Behind\nThe Spruce / Heather Norman\nBecause the grass clippings will be wet, they'll stick together in large clumps. Not only are these clumps unsightly, but they are also bad for your lawn's health: They tend to smother the grass. You will have to rake those grass clumps, meaning more work for you.\n07\nof 08\nYou Won't Get That Manicured Look\nThe Spruce / Jodi Espinosa\nFor that manicured look most people crave, your grass blades must be standing erect as you're cutting them. You don't get this when the grass is wet. The moisture sitting on the blades weighs them down. Your mower blade will spin right over many of the depressed blades. Once drying occurs, these uncut blades spring back up, looking like cowlicks.\n08\nof 08\nMowing Wet Grass Is Messy\nronstik / Getty Images\nAs if all of these objections weren't enough, mowing wet grass is messy. The wet clumps of grass produced get all over everything. So even when the job is over, it's not really over: You'll have to take more time and energy to clean your mower, your shoes, etc.\nWhat to Do If You Have to Mow Wet Grass\nBut what if you must break the rule and mow wet grass in a particular instance, even though it's not the best time to mow a lawn? Here are a few tricks to use to make the best of a bad situation.\nWear non-slip shoes. Combat the danger of slipping on wet turf by paying attention to the footwear you put on before you mow. Wear shoes that have good traction.\nClean the mower periodically. Keep a rag and a putty knife with you as you mow so that, periodically, you can clean both the top and the bottom of the mower.\nCut less grass. If you scale back how much grass is being cut at any one time, you can reduce the number of clumps.\nFAQ\nHow do you know if grass is too wet to mow?\nIf the grass blades are holding enough moisture to be weighed down to the ground, then the grass is too wet to mow. Wait until they're standing up again.\nIs it okay to cut grass in the morning?\nMid-morning is okay. The dew will have evaporated by then.\nHow long after it rains can I cut the grass?\nThis depends on factors like how hard/long it rained, whether or not there's a drying wind and/or hot sunshine, and how well your soil drains. The best way to tell when it's time to mow is to feel the grass. If it's wet to the touch, then it's too soon to mow."

Maybe you're trying to add the perfect dose of fright to your space for the spooky season. Perhaps you love Halloween but want to display that subtly. Regardless, August is the perfect time to get started.\nLuckily for us, our favorite brand to DIY and hack has released new collections to help us get started. IKEA released a fall collection (HOSTKVALL) and their first-ever Halloween collection (KUSTFYR) to get us excited for the upcoming season and holiday.\nHere are 8 of our favorite items from the collections that have us dreaming of fall, Halloween, and all the festivities they entail.\nGhost LED Table Lamp\nIKEA\nLet this friendly ghost serve as your nightlight during the spooky season. Or, let the purple light create a festive atmosphere at your big Halloween bash. Either way, this small lamp introduces just enough festivity without the inconvenience: easily store it away at the end of the season. \nPumpkin String Lights\nIKEA\nTake your Halloween party to the next level by adding these pumpkin string lights into the mix. They glow a bright orange hue and can be used both indoors and outdoors. Consider pairing these with other Halloween-themed light fixtures in different colors to create the ultimate atmosphere to celebrate.\nArtificial Bouquet\nIKEA\nElevate your space with this muted artificial bouquet. In tones reminiscent of the leaves changing colors, this will inevitably introduce an autumn element into your home that transcends beyond Halloween. Hang them on a wall or display them in a vase in your entryway. This way, guests are greeted by the homey and warm feeling the season evokes. \nPumpkin Tealight Holder\nIKEA\nDo you want the spooky jack-o-lantern look without getting your hands dirty carving a pumpkin? You're in luck. This tealight holder has the same decorative element and function as a traditional jack-o-lantern without the orange gooey mess.\nDecorative Pumpkins\nIKEA\nElevate your Halloween tablescape with these little decorative pumpkins. Picture this: a costume dinner party table with orange decor, fake spiders, spooky and gory-inspired meals, and a combination of real pumpkins and these decorative pumpkins scattered throughout. That followed by a horror movie sounds like the perfect Halloween to me.\nOrange Throw Blanket\nIKEA\nIf you want to embrace the Halloween spirit and show festivity but do so subtly, consider sprawling this orange throw blanket over your sofa. You can decorate your home for the season without pumpkins, skeletons, and ghosts by introducing accessories in autumn tones. \nHanging Tapestry\nIKEA\nStraightforward and right to the point: you love Halloween and you want all of your guests to know it. Hang this tapestry in your home for an exciting constant reminder of the upcoming holiday.\nCinnamon and Sugar Scented Candle\nIKEA\nGet all of your senses into the autumn spirit. What scents remind you of the season? If your favorite autumn scents lean towards the sweeter side, consider filling your home with the aroma of cinnamon and sugar. Embrace the warm, aromatic feeling of fall.\nBoo Door Mat\nIKEA\nGreet trick-or-treaters appropriately with this Halloween-themed doormat. If you don't want to go all out, simply switch out your doormat at the beginning of the season for a touch of spooky season spirit."

You can narrow your search by material, length, hanging style, and machine-washable curtains. But like many items from the retailer, the prices aren’t the most budget-friendly. However, Pottery Barn’s prices are a reflection of its stellar quality.\nPottery Barn is a retailer we highly recommend for shoppers with larger windows who may need something custom. The brand has over 20 custom curtain options and a wide range of fabrics.\nReturn policy: 30 days; custom curtains are not returnable | Delivery options: In-store pickup using ship-to-store delivery, shipping to home, pick up at UPS access points | Perks: Members of The Key earn 2 percent back in rewards at Pottery Barn | Customization available: Yes\nPHOTO: The Spruce / Katie Begley\nAmazon\nAmazon\nBuy on Amazon\nWhat We Like\nGenerally easy returns\nAmazon Basic curtains are popular\nWhat We Don't Like\nQuality can vary\nTakes time to sift through options\nOver 20,000 results appear with a simple \"curtains\" search on Amazon. With thousands of reviews to read and best-seller options, you're bound to find the best curtains for your home. But if time is against you and you don't have the free time to scroll, we highly recommend the Nicetown Thermal Insulated Grommet Curtains for its full drape construction and lovely texture. \nYou can also never go wrong with the AmazonBasics line. We found several blackout curtains in various textures at an affordable price. And if you need hardware, our testers love the Umbra Twilight Single Curtain Rod Set for its ability to sit directly against the wall. Pair this with one of Amazon’s heavyweight blackout curtains; no peep of light will shine through.\nAnd if you have an Amazon Prime account, that is even better. Your new pair of curtains can be delivered within two days, sometimes within hours of placing your order. We recommend purchasing directly from Amazon rather than from a third-party seller–the return process is far more straightforward for products purchased from Amazon.\nReturn policy: Within 30 days for items sold by Amazon, third-party sellers may vary | Delivery options: Carriers include UPS, Amazon, and third-party vendors | Perks: Amazon Prime members get free 2-day shipping | Customization available: No\nPHOTO: The Spruce / Stacey L. Nash\nWayfair\nWayfair\nBuy on Wayfair\nWhat We Like\nGreat customer service\nLarge selection\nFrequent sales\nWhat We Don't Like\nOverwhelming array of options\nWayfair is an online marketplace for all things home, from furniture to cookware to bedding to decor. Like Amazon, Wayfair sells an extensive array of curtains in different styles and sizes at every price point. The retailer has an entire section devoted to blackout curtains, with over 7,000 options.\nWith over 50,000 options, shopping for curtains on Wayfair can be overwhelming, but the retailer’s intricate filter tool helps shorten the search time. You can narrow your search by size, color, light filtration, room location, and more. To lighten your load, we recommend having an idea of what you want before you browse. \nFor those looking for an elegant pair of velvet blackout curtains, the Gracie Oaks Olivia Signature Velvet Curtains are Spruce-approved and excellent in quality and feel. And like our favorite IKEA blackout curtains, the Majgull Blackout Curtain, these Gracie Oaks curtains muffle outside noise.\nAnd for hardware, we love the Wayfair Basics Adjustable Curtain Rod, which doesn’t support fabric weighing more than 7 pounds but has a telescoping rod, many color options, and decorative ball finials.\nReturn policy: Within 30 days (shipping charges not refunded) | Delivery options: Most deliveries made by UPS or FedEx | Perks: Wayfair's credit card offers 5 percent back in rewards that don't expire | Customization available: No\nPHOTO: The Spruce / Eric Brockob\nTarget\nTarget\nBuy on Target\nWhat We Like\nWide selection\nOn-trend looks\nWhat We Don't Like\nMay not hold up for long-term use\nAs with its other housewares, Target offers affordable and stylish curtains. At the time of publication, more than 2,000 curtains were available, organized by length and light filtration level.\nSome of our favorite options include the Bella Sheer Hidden Tab Top Curtain Panels, which have a breezy look and feel that would suit the bedroom (though not if you're sensitive to light, as they're fairly sheer). The Eclipse's Blackout Window Panel is ideal for those needing maximum darkness but not wanting to skimp on style.\nTarget's website is easy to browse. In addition to length, you can filter by pattern, material, and heading style (such as grommet top or pleated). The retailer offers free shipping on orders over $35 and a generous 90-day return policy. Pro tip: To find deeply discounted window treatments, go to the Home section of Clearance and filter by \"curtain panels.\"\nReturn policy: Items must be returned within 90 days of purchase with original receipt | Delivery options: Standard shipping (carriers vary), curbside pickup, or in-store pickup | Perks: Exclusive discounts after signing up for Target Circle; Target Red Card holders also get benefits like free 2-day shipping, 5 percent savings, and an additional 30 days for returns | Customization available: No\nIkea\nIKEA\nBuy on Ikea\nWhat We Like\nHundreds of curtain options\nParticularly great selection of blackout curtains\nWhat We Don't Like\nCustomer service is mixed\nNot many prints\nKnown for their affordable prices, DIY and customizable pieces, and decor galore, Ikea is one of the best places to shop for curtains if you want endless options. The retailer has many solid and minimal options and fun printed ones for your little one.\nIf you appreciate getting an extra hour or two of shut-eye, we recommend snagging the Majgull Blackout Curtain. We tested these and found that the curtains block out around 95 percent of light and even limit outside noise. The color options are limited, but you’ll get a solid, durable pair of curtains. And if you want a pair of lighter, breezier curtains, the crushed linen Dytag Curtains is a high-end pick still under $100.\nAlong with curtains, Ikea is also one of the best places to buy rugs. The retailer offers various natural fiber rugs at an affordable price, with one of our favorite area rugs being the Vedbak area rug, starting at just $60. And if you’re a fan of jute rugs, Ikea is the place to shop.\nIkea is a great place for shoppers looking for something affordable that doesn’t lack quality. And if you’re looking for even further discounted window treatments and coverings, you can find some stellar picks in the Deals sections under “Our Lowest Prices.”\nReturn policy: New and unopened products within 365 days, open products within 180 days | Delivery options: Flat-rate delivery starts at $5 using local third-party companies | Perks: IKEA Family program gives a discount, exclusive deals, and a birthday offer | Customization available: No\nPHOTO: The Spruce / Eric Brockob\nQuince\nQuince\nView on Quince.com\nWhat We Like\nGreat neutral selection\nAvailable in several lengths\nWhat We Don't Like\nNot ideal if you're looking for bold options\nFrom the best Turkish towels to luxury bedding, Quince is our go-to for everything home, including the best curtains. Quince is more affordable than Pottery Barn, with curtain prices starting just under $50. And whether you prefer cotton, silk, linen, or velvet curtains, Quince has it all.\nUnlike other home brands in our guide, we love how Quince helps you find the perfect curtains for your windows based on your interior design style, from modern and contemporary to mid-century to traditional. And if you like to keep things minimal yet fun, add some stripes to your space with the Coastal Stripe Linen Cotton Curtain.\nAnd while you're cozying up your living room, we recommend adding the Quince Saje Wool Shag Rug, one of the best wool rugs in our guide. It’s a simple and cushioned rug that complements most decor. Plus, it comes in five sizes, including a runner option.\nReturn policy: 365 days | Delivery options: 6-9 business days, U.S. orders only | Perks: Get $20 off your next order when you refer a friend, earn Quince credit when shopping with Quince partners, and U.S. Military, first responders, nurses, and educators receive 10 percent off | Customization available: No\nCB2\nCB2\nView on CB2\nWhat We Like\nLuxurious fabrics\nFour length options\nFree shipping\nWhat We Don't Like\nPricey\nKnown for its modern and sophisticated furnishings and home decor, CB2 has over 70 contemporary, sleek, and minimal designed curtains, from dark green velvet blackout curtains to warm white linen.\nAlthough Pottery Barn shares a similar level of quality, CB2 is slightly more affordable and has an elevated, contemporary style. We recommend shopping at CB2 for modern curtains with a chic flare.\nWith several color options and fabric materials, this retailer is perfect for those who want to add a pop of color and texture to their space. For example, the Seda Smoked Yellow Dupioni Silk Curtain is simple yet unique in style with its solid, mustard yellow color and 100 percent silk material that’s not an everyday curtain material.\nThe best part is that all the curtains at CB2 ship for free. So, while the retailer may be more expensive than Wayfair, Amazon, and IKEA, you don’t have to worry about calculating an additional shipping fee. Plus, the quality of craftsmanship is like no other. \nReturn policy: Eligible new and unused/resealable items are returnable within 30 days of receipt | Delivery options: Free In-store pickup and ship-to store, shipping to home | Perks: Earn 10 percent cash back on merchandise purchases at CB2 and Crate & Barrel with CB2 credit card, 15 percent off full-price items with text and email sign-up\nAnthropologie\nAnthropologie\nBuy on Anthropologie\nWhat We Like\nQuirky, eclectic styles\nLots of interesting details\nUnusual hardware and tie-backs\nWhat We Don't Like\nSearch is limited\nItems sell out quickly\nYou may know Anthropologie for its bohemian, free-spirited fashions. That eclectic-style clothing has spilled over into AnthroLiving Home with fun and quirky home decor and the most gorgeous and unique curtains.\nLike CB2, Anthropologie has various curtain styles in different textures, such as velvet, linen, tweed, sheer polyester, and more. But unlike all the retailers on our list, Anthropologie has over 100 patterned curtains, from checkered prints to stripes to embroidered tiger designs to gingham. This is the best place to buy curtains for those who want their decor to be statement pieces. \nWhile there are over 150 curtains to browse through, you can make your search easier by filtering the results by light filtration, pattern, material, size, and more. The brand doesn’t offer any customizations, but with unique and whimsical designs like the Embroidered Mannette Curtain, which comes in four sizes, there’s no need.\nReturn policy: 60 days for full refund, merchandise credit after that | Delivery options: 2 to 8 business days, carriers vary, or in-store pickup for some items | Perks: Customers will receive free shipping on next order, along with announcements about sale events, with email signup | Customization: No\nAdvertisement\nJC Penney\nJC Penney\nBuy on Jcpenney.com\nWhat We Like\nMany sales and coupon offers\nWide selection\nSite is easy to search\nWhat We Don't Like\nStyles tend to be fairly traditional\nNot many shopper reviews\nJCPenney, which has roughly 650 stores nationwide, has an impressive selection of curtains, valances, and window tiers, as well as many different types of shades and hardware. The site is easy to search, as shoppers can select filters such as brand (there are dozens), item type, price, and deals (at press time, more than 1,800 curtains were listed as on sale). \nAlthough JCPenney isn't reinventing the wheel regarding style, there are plenty of attractive, well-made options, and prices tend to be reasonable, especially given the number of discounts that tend to be available.\nJCPenney has a 60-day return policy, which is helpful because one of the site's main downsides is the dearth of shopper reviews. If you're looking for something custom, the only options currently available are the Bali Coastal and the Bali Valencia. Both are simple, light-filtering panels and have a customizable length to the nearest fraction of an inch (the width is fixed at 50 inches).\nThe current deals flash across the top of the website and might include specific events and might include an extra 30 percent off with a code, a dorm flash sale, and doorbusters, which are excluded from coupons. There are also many curtains sold in the clearance section.\nReturn policy: 60 days | Delivery options: Standard shipping with USPS or UPS, same-day through DoorDash, in-store pickup | Perks: JCPenney Rewards members get 30 percent off with signup, $10 reward for every $200 spent, a birthday gift, and other offers | Customization: Only for one type of curtain, but many options for shades\nAnnie Selke\nCourtesy of Annie Selke\nBuy on Annieselke.com\nWhat We Like\nHigh-quality\nEye-catching patterns\nProducts made in fair-labor conditions\nWhat We Don't Like\nSomewhat small selection\nAnnie Selke doesn’t have the largest selection of curtains, but it’s the perfect spot for those who get overwhelmed browsing through thousands of curtain options. Unlike most retailers on our list, Annie Selke has many elegant pattern options and solid ones. The quality of the curtains is high, so the prices are higher.\nThe site has 28 different curtain panels, including linen, cotton, and polyester. Whether your interior design style is modern farmhouse, modern, or bohemian, Annie Selke has a curtain to match over seven design styles. While we haven’t tested an Annie Selke curtain for ourselves, the Folly Indoor Outdoor Rug is one of the best rugs we’ve tested for its handmade, eye-catching design and soft texture. \nCurtain prices retail from $98 to $378. However, the retailer has a sale section that includes discounted linen curtain panels, rods, and other window accessories.\nReturn policy: 30 days | Delivery options: Carriers such as UPS or USPS | Perks: 15 percent off with email signup | Customization: No\nSociety6\nCourtesy of Society6\nBuy on Society6.com\nWhat We Like\nUnusual designs\nPurchase supports independent artists\nWhat We Don't Like\nLimited number of styles and header types\nNo customization\nSociety6 is an online marketplace of more than 450,000 artists from 170 countries. The gist: Artists upload their original designs, and Society6 puts them on items like cell phone holders, wall art, and, you guessed it—curtains. Artists receive a 10 percent commission from each sale, so you can feel good knowing that at least a small part of your purchase goes directly to them.\nThe selection is straightforward: You can choose sheer curtains or blackout curtains in two different size options. At press time, both cost less than $150 for a pair, with single panels also available. They currently only have pole-pocket headers, so those who want grommets or tab tops are out of luck. \nAlthough the price might seem high compared to big box stores, you're paying for a distinctive piece of art that you likely won't see in your friends' windows. The selection is massive, but you can filter results by categories like popular, new, or random, as well as design style, and there are subcategories within those as well. The retro section has a subcategory called \"midcentury,\" where you can find options like this Modern Abstract Blackout Curtain by Tony Magner.\nReturn policy: 60 days | Delivery options: Standard (U.S. and international), expedited, rush | Perks: 25 percent off order with email signup | Customization: No\n58 Wall Decor Ideas to Transform Every Room in the House\nWhat to Look for in Places to Buy Curtains\nSelection\nThe larger the selection, the more options you have, and it's more likely you'll find the perfect pair of curtains that matches your space and design style. However, large online marketplaces such as Amazon and Wayfair have over 20,000 curtains, which is great for endless options but can be overwhelming. \nRetailers such as Pottery Barn, IKEA, CB2, and Anthropologie offer an impressive array of 200 curtains (a little less overwhelming) and various design styles, materials, light filtration, and more. \nPrice Range\nCurtains are offered at a wide range of prices. While higher-quality curtains often come with a higher price tag, retailers like Wayfair and Amazon offer a more extensive price range and quality picks. \nSimilar to having a large selection, the best places to buy curtains are at retailers like IKEA, Amazon, and Wayfair. These retailers cover every price point, from $10 budget options like the IKEA Bengta Blackout Curtain to a higher-end $75 pair like the Dytag Curtains.\nShipping Times\nWhile some retailers, like Amazon, can ship your curtain order in two days or less, others, especially custom curtain orders, often require several weeks of lead time. It’s important to read each brand’s shipping options and give yourself a two—to three-week shipping window for order processing or shipping delays.\nIf time is against you, you may want to consider in-store pickup using ship-to-store delivery. Spots like CB2 and Pottery Barn offer in-store shipping for cities with a store location.\nFAQ\nWhen's the best time to buy new curtains?\n\"If you're looking for a major curtain overhaul throughout your home, consider holding off for one of the major holidays that's bound to come with major sales, like Memorial Day, July 4th, or Black Friday,\" says Heather Goerzen, design editor at Havenly, an online interior design service. She also suggests swapping out your curtains when you want a change of color palette or something to mark a new season. \"Whether it's breezy spring or cozy fall, if you're looking to welcome a change of season, consider swapping to sheer curtains or a more luxurious velvet,\" she says.\nHow often should you replace your curtains?\nThere isn't a hard-and-fast rule—instead, let your intuition guide you. \"My recommendation is to keep an eye on them for either extreme fading due to harsh sunlight or wear and tear—things like pet hair or snags,\" says Goerzen. Depending on the material, dusting, gently vacuuming, machine-washing, or dry-cleaning should also help prolong their life and keep them looking fresh. However, you may also naturally gravitate to new textiles every few years. \"I had some bold navy velvet curtains that I loved for several years, but I wanted to update our living room to feel lighter, fresher, and a little more timeless, so I ultimately swapped them out for a more neutral and natural linen material,\" Goerzen shares.\nIs it better to buy curtains online or in person?\nAlthough it's always nice to see and feel the materials in person, shopping online offers an impressive array of choices when it comes to home decor. \"I tend to scour online and narrow down my selections. Then, I'll buy three or four options with flexible return policies to see the fabric, color, and design in real life,\" says Goerzen. Textile-focused companies like Pottery Barn, Annie Selke, Pepper Home, and Smith & Noble also offer free or inexpensive swatches. Note that custom-made curtains won't be eligible for returns, so it's best to try to at least get a sense of the fabric first.\nWhy Trust The Spruce?\nThis article was written by Kenedee Fowler, a shopping writer for The Spruce. For this article, Kenedee used her personal shopping experience with the brands on the list as well as our editor’s testing experience with specific curtains from each retailer. She included a list of larger companies with an extensive price range, covering every budget, and reputable brands with a large curtain selection, carrying various design styles, materials, and customization options.\nOur Expert:\nHeather Goerzen, design editor at Havenly, an online interior design service\nThe 20 Best Places to Buy Rugs Online of 2024"

  "articleText": "CLEANING & ORGANIZING ORGANIZING\n49 Storage Ideas for Your Entire Home\nBy ELIZABETH LARKIN\nand KATE VAN PELT\nUpdated on 11/13/24\nReviewed by KATHERINE PICOTT\nThe Spruce / Leticia Almeida\nOrganization can feel like a moving target, especially if you're short on space—or have lots of stuff. Fortunately, there are a range of versatile storage ideas for clothes, small closets, or tiny spaces that are inexpensive and effective. You can use affordable, easy and DIY ideas like shelving, multipurpose furniture, storage baskets and chests to create storage solutions in your home.\nBelow, you'll find creative solutions that can help you declutter every room in your home. Simple choices like purchasing storage bins based on what you're storing, choosing containers of varying sizes instead of identical bins, and locating a storage space before boxing everything up can help you organize strategically and efficiently. You may want to vary your storage depending on whether you're looking at bedroom clothing storage, bathroom linens, kitchen storage, living room storage, closets, garages, or toy rooms.\nRead on for some of our favorite storage ideas you can use throughout your home.\n01\nof 49\nUse Chalkboard Labels for Changing Storage Needs\n@neatbymeg / Instagram\nLabels are a professional home organizer's best friend, which might explain why there are so many types of labels and label makers to buy. Chalkboard labels are a great choice not only because of the stylish look, but also because they can be updated easily. If you expect the contents of your storage bin to fluctuate, such as back-to-school supplies to summer craft projects, consider chalkboard labels.\n02\nof 49\nHang Hats on the Wall\n@afreshspace / Instagram\nWhether you like ball caps or berets, it can be challenging to store a hat collection without damaging their shape. Hats are the perfect item to occupy some wall space in your closet. Not only will you protect them from getting flattened in a box, but you'll be surprised with how stylish they look on display.\n03\nof 49\nSave Counter Space With a Dish Drying Cabinet\nDoornob\nThis trick is currently all the rage in northern Europe, where modern design always seems to be at the forefront of everyone's minds (think: IKEA). Install a dish drying rack in a cabinet above your sink to save space on the countertop.\n04\nof 49\nNest Your Tupperware Together\nPolished Habitat\nTupperware storage and food storage containers aren't that easy to store, but sorting them by size can help considerably. Nest your storage containers together to keep them streamlined and organized. If your collection of food storage containers is a little chaotic, sort through and limit your collection to three or four different sizes so that you can nest them together more efficiently.\nContinue to 5 of 49 below\n05\nof 49\nPurchase Handbag Hangers for Purses\n@afreshspace / Instagram\nThose with a love for handbags may baulk at the thought of stuffing their bags into a plastic bin under the bed. Fortunately, there are a number of ways to store purses, including specially designed handbag hangers that will help you keep your bags in perfect shape.\n06\nof 49\nCreate Pretend Pull-Out Drawers\nEveryday Organizing\nIf you can't install pull-out storage, or don't want to deal with the hassle, bins are the perfect alternative. This solution allows you to see what's in the back of your cabinet without removing all of the items in the front. Simply slide out the bin, grab what you need, and slid it back.\n07\nof 49\nDiscover a Smarter Way to Organize Your Pans\niHeart Organizing\nUse wire racks in your cabinet to you store anything long and thin, like baking dishes, cutting boards, or even sauté pans. This is a much more effective storage solution than stacking, since you won't have to lift an entire set of goods out of the cupboard to access the one item you need.\n08\nof 49\nMake a DIY Plastic Bag Dispenser\nPolished Habitat\nThe idea of repurposing an item rather than throwing it away is not a new concept, but when a good idea comes along, especially one so simple, it feels like a spark of genius. Save your empty tissue box to keep plastic bags organized and within easy reach.\nContinue to 9 of 49 below\n09\nof 49\nPaint Pen Kitchen Organization\nA Beautiful Mess\nRelocate the grains and spices you use often into clear storage containers. Label them using paint pens for an attractive display, then arrange the containers in alphabetical order to make items like flour, rice, or oats even easier to locate. This tip also helps you keep track of how much you have of an ingredient, so you'll never accidentally run out.\n10\nof 49\nMake Above-Cabinet Storage Visible\nA Beautiful Mess\nThe key to making storage on top of the refrigerator and kitchen cabinets work is visibility. If you can't see the items you've stored up high, you'll forget what's there until they've long expired. Swap your woven baskets for wire to fix the issue. Wire is also more durable and easier to clean, which is essential for exposed storage.\n11\nof 49\nRecycle Boxes to Organize Your Freezer\nQueen Bee Coupons\nIf you like to stock up and store things in your freezer, you know how quickly a mess can develop if you fail to institute some organization. A simple way to help you keep the freezer tidy is to cut the tops off of used cardboard boxes, label them, and fill them with frozen items for easy retrieval. This tip works especially well for pre-made freezer meals.\n12\nof 49\nBuild a DIY Trash Bag Roll\nSimply Organized\nThis clever hack will save you the frustration of wrestling a bag out of the box every time you take out your trash. Each bag holder is made with two curtain rod hangers and a short length of wood dowel, which you can find at any hardware store or home center.\nContinue to 13 of 49 below\n13\nof 49\nHang Your Measuring Spoons\nTidy Mom\nNo one enjoys digging through a kitchen drawer for the elusive quarter teaspoon, and this easy tip saves you the trouble. Pick up a few tiny adhesive hooks from your local hardware store, attach them to the inside of a kitchen cabinet door (such as the cabinet with your baking supplies), and hang your measuring spoons.\n14\nof 49\nSeparate Garbage, Compost, and Recycling\nNadiia Fedorova / Getty Images\nEven your garbage deserves a little organization. To keep your trash and recycling separate and tidy, purchase a set of matching bins to store side-by-side. Designate a pull-out cabinet or drawer, if possible, to keep the sight (and smells) hidden. If you have plenty of space to work with, purchase an additional smaller bin for compost.\n15\nof 49\nStore Medicines and Prescriptions in a Deep Drawer\n@neatbymeg / Instagram\nTossing Band-Aids and cough syrup into a deep drawer make seem convenient, but that's hardly the case when your little one falls or catches a cold. Instead, use drawer dividers to sort your items into categories so they're easier to find, then arrange them upright to make the most of the drawer's depth.\n16\nof 49\nRepurpose Your Mint Container\nLovely Indeed\nSmall items like bobby pins and Q-tips may be easy to store because of their size, but they're tough to keep organized. This mint dispenser idea is a brilliant way to corral a bunch of small items together to make them easy to find when needed.\nContinue to 17 of 49 below\n17\nof 49\nCreate a Discreet Charging Station\nCaught on a Whim\nIf you don't care for the sight of cell phones and iPads crowding your counters, turn an old book into a hidden charging station. This is a helpful tip for those who like to keep their devices close, but also out of sight, especially from children and guests.\n18\nof 49\nSort Earrings With an Upcycled Organizer\nSmart n Snazzy\nSkip the hassle of digging around for a matching set of earrings. This idea allows you to repurpose a cardboard box and organize and display your earrings in a cute and functional way. Punch a series of holes in the bottom of each box using a push pin. Hook the earrings through holes to hang them and use the matching half of the box to create a stand. \n19\nof 49\nRepurpose a Coke Crate to Store Your Ties\nRain on a Tin Roof\nIf you like the vintage aesthetic, you'll be thrilled to know there are many ways to give antique items a new purpose. An old soda crate, for instance, is the perfect storage compartment for ties and scarves. Simply roll up the fabric and place it in one of the slots.\n20\nof 49\nStore Underwear in PVC Pipes\nInfarrantly Creative\nKeep your undies organized with a cubby-hole arrangement of PVC pipe sections. Cut the three-inch-diameter pipe into pieces that fit the height of your drawer, then sand the cut edges to make them smooth. Paint the pipes, if desired, and glue them together. This also works well for small accessories like scrunchies.\nContinue to 21 of 49 below\n21\nof 49\nLabel Toy Drawers With Pictures\nFamily Ever After\nThis idea is perfect for children who need a little extra help finding and putting away their toys. By labeling the drawers with pictures instead of words, even little ones who can't yet read will know exactly which toys go in which drawers.\n22\nof 49\nUse a Shoe Organizer for Storing Stuffed Animals\nMommo Design\nOver-the-door shoe organizers can certainly help you keep sandals and boots sorted, but this tool is far more versatile. For instance, this simple organizer leverages vertical storage and can be repurposed to store your children's small toys and stuffed animals.\n23\nof 49\nCreate a Gallery Wall for Kids' Artwork\nFamily Ever After\nKids' artwork can pile up quickly. Hanging it rather than keeping it in a pile means less clutter. Regularly rotate new projects and artwork every few months (or weeks, depending on how artsy your kids are).\n24\nof 49\nUse Large Paper Clips to Hold Cables\nLuis Diaz Devesa / Getty Images\nOrganizing electrical cords for all your devices and small appliances can be difficult, especially if you regularly unplug and plug in items. Threading cords through large paper clips that are fastened to the edge of your desk can make it easier to access the cable you need when you need it.\nContinue to 25 of 49 below\n25\nof 49\nSort Cords in a Recycled Shoebox\nDarkroom & Dearly\nTech clutter happens to the best of us. Storing chargers and other electronic accessories can be a real pain, but this straightforward DIY tip can help you keep everyday tech accessories organized. All you need is some cardboard, wrapping paper, and (of course) labels.\n26\nof 49\nConvert a Closet Into an Office Supply\n@afreshspace / Instagram\nOffice spaces can be among the more difficult areas to organize in a home. If you find your desk often cluttered with miscellaneous files and pens and post-its, you might benefit from this organization tip. Claim a nearby closet for excess office supplies, especially those you don't use daily.\n27\nof 49\nMake a DIY Twine Keeper\nWhisker Graphics\nBalls of string, twine, and ribbon can become a jumbled mess when stored in a drawer. Instead, try storing them in a sugar dispenser. The jar protects your string and such from becoming tangled, and the nifty pour spout makes accessing the material simple.\n28\nof 49\nInstall a Pegboard for Tools and Craft Supplies\nBrit + Co\nA pegboard can store and organize various household products, such as garage tools and craft supplies like scissors and tape. The trick to hanging pegboard is to mount it over wood strips or blocks to create a small space between the pegboard and the wall. The space is necessary for adding hooks, brackets, and other hanging hardwood onto the pegboard.\nContinue to 29 of 49 below\n29\nof 49\nMount a Magazine File on the Kitchen Cabinet Door\nEveryday Dishes\nJust like shoe organizers, magazine files can help you sort much more than paper. For instance, a clever way to store foil, plastic wrap, parchment, and wax paper is to hang a magazine file on a kitchen cabinet door. This will free up drawer space for your utensils, flatware, and other items.\n30\nof 49\nRepurpose Deep Kitchen Drawers for Bread and Root Vegetables\nSt. Charles of New York\nBread and root vegetables are best kept in a cool, dry area of the kitchen. Store these items in a deep drawer to free up some counter space. Be sure to choose a drawer away from the oven, since the heat could make your food go bad quicker. Additionally, since root vegetables need air to stave off rot, consider replacing the drawer bottoms or sides with mesh.\n31\nof 49\nAdd Hooks Inside Bathroom Cabinet Doors\nClean and Scentsible\nIf you're lucky enough to have a bathroom drawer, it is usually the first spot to get crowded. To add some extra storage space, hang some hooks inside your bathroom cabinet doors. This tip works well for items premade with loops or holes for hanging, such as scrub brushes, scissors, shavers, scrunchie sponges, hair ties, and more.\n32\nof 49\nInstall a Magnetic Strip Hair and Nail Tools\nDarkroom & Dearly\nAccessories or tools made of iron, nickel, or cobalt are magnetic. Most hair and nail items are stainless steel, which contains iron. You can easily hang bobby pins, hair clips, barrettes, nail files, tweezers, and nail clippers on a magnetic strip inside a bathroom drawer to alleviate your bathroom storage woes.\nContinue to 33 of 49 below\n33\nof 49\nBuild a Dog Bed Trundle\nHGTV\nIf the floor space in your bedroom feels cramped, consider building a dog bed trundle. You can make your own dog bed with an old crib mattress, or pick up a thin bed at your neighborhood department store, and construct a roll-out platform with a few simple products at your local hardware store.\n34\nof 49\nMove Garage Storage to the Walls and Ceiling\n@neatbymeg / Instagram\nGarages can feel like oversized junk drawers if you're not intentional about organizing. Instead of stacking boxes and bins on the floor, install some storage racks on the wall and ceiling. The wall mount rack is perfect for yard tools, scooters and bikes, and more. Store seasonal supplies and other items used less often overhead.\n35\nof 49\nTransform Your Paper Towel Holder\nThe Spruce / Antonis Achilleos\nA paper towel holder is another versatile organizer. Use one in the office for all your tapes—masking, packing, and duct tape. This giant spool also works well for storing rolls of ribbon or yarn for knitting, sewing, or crafting. Belts also have a way of multiplying, but coil them around this hand caddy for an easy grab when needed.\n36\nof 49\nUse a Muffin Tin Storing Small Items\nEtsy\nTool sheds, garages, and offices are riddled with miniature items like nails, screws, nuts, bolts, paper clips, push pins, and safety pins. Repurpose an old muffin tin or fishing tackle box that you don't use anymore for these tiny supplies.\nContinue to 37 of 49 below\n37\nof 49\nReuse Shoe Pocket Caddies for Pantry Goods\nThe 36th Avenue\nShoe pocket caddies can be the perfect organizer for a wide range of goods, especially when utilized in small closet storage. In the pantry, use them for kitchen utensils, garbage can liners, rubber bands, pencils, and scissors. Other uses include cleaning supplies like spray bottles and cans, sponges, and scrub brushes. Families with young children can also use these nifty organizers as a snack food caddy for granola bars, cookies, chips, and candy.\n38\nof 49\nKitchen Lid Rack for Purse Clutches\nFabulous Fashions for Sensible Style\nPurse clutches are slim and stylish, making them perfect for a night on the town. Unfortunately, they don't often come with loops or hooks for hanging. Instead of taking up a drawer, find some extra shelf space and vertically file your clutches in a pot and pan lid rack. This trick offers easy access when it's time for your next soiree.\n39\nof 49\nInstall for Shelves Near Garage or Mudroom Door\n@afreshspace / Instagram\nThere are multiple supplies you might need access to on your way in and out of the garage or mudroom, and this organization tip is the perfect solution. Install some strong metal shelves to store heavy-duty trash bags, gloves and boots, dog leashes, and more. If you want to give the shelving rack some aesthetic appeal, choose woven baskets over wire or plastic bins.\n40\nof 49\nHang Baskets Sideways for Towel Storage\nThe Spruce\nIf you have a pair of sturdy rectangular baskets being underutilized, turn them on their side and screw them into the wall along their bottoms for vertical bathroom storage. Fill them with towels, washcloths, or toilet paper rolls for a cute, but clever, storage solution.\nContinue to 41 of 49 below\n41\nof 49\nReuse Empty Glass Jars\nJess Bailey / Unsplash\nEmpty Mason jars make great storage for nails, clothespins, paperclips, pushpins, bobby pins, cotton swabs, and more. The clear glass makes it easy to find what you need quickly. Screw-top jars can be used for storage throughout the home, the garage, pantry, office, and bathroom.\n42\nof 49\nBuild a Bungee Cord Ball Caddy\nRuggy DIY\nYou can breathe new life into a crate or plywood box by turning it into a caddy for basketballs, soccer balls, footballs, and more. Turn it on its side, string some bungee cords along the front, and grab a ball when needed. Pop it back in when you're done.\n43\nof 49\nUse a Lazy Susan in the Fridge\nThe Spruce / Kevin Norris\nLazy Susans make for great storage solutions in closets and cabinets, as well as the refrigerator. Particularly if you have a deep fridge, it can be a hassle to shuffle through foodstuffs in the front to reach supplies in the back. A rotating tray, however, makes it easy to grab what you need when you need it.\n44\nof 49\nUse Carabiners for Hair Ties and Rubber Bands\nOne Hundred Dollars a Month\nA carabiner is commonly used for rock climbing and linking together ropes and harnesses, but this handy metal clip is also fantastic for keeping together hair ties and holding onto keys, belts, and handbags. Attach the carabiner to your toiletries bag during travel and hang it on a Command hook inside your bathroom cabinet door at home.\nContinue to 45 of 49 below\n45\nof 49\nRepurpose a Letter Organizer for Flip Flops\nOrganization Obsessed\nFlip flops and sandals are awkward to hang on shoe racks, since they often slip out. That's why you have to get creative with shoe storage in the closet. Grab your slippers and file them away in a letter organizer vertically. Place them on a shelf in a closet or near a back door or garage door for easy access.\n46\nof 49\nHang Jeans for Clever Clothes Storage\n@afreshspace / Instagram\nFolding your jeans might seem like the most obvious way to store them, but what happens when you need to reach a pair at the bottom of the pile? Your neat stack becomes a heap of denim. Hanging jeans vertically is a clever way to store them and take up less room.\n47\nof 49\nUse the Space Under Stairs for Shelving\n@afreshspace / Instagram\nIf your stairs are located in the middle of your house, you may have empty walls that feel imposing and blank. Make them a focal point by adding shelving, giving you a place to display beautiful objets and art.\n48\nof 49\nUse a Multipurpose Island\nFinding Lovely\nA kitchen island isn't just a place for prep work. You can incorporate an island into your space that is multipurpose with storage space and racks for towels. The open storage on this kitchen island makes it easy to reach for what you need.\nContinue to 49 of 49 below\n49\nof 49\nPut a Dresser in Your Entryway\nFinding Lovely\nThis dresser makes the most of both an entryway and an under-the-stairs spot. It's a beautiful antique piece that's been perfectly styled, but it also gives you several drawers for storing everything from blankets to extra phone chargers to items you might need on your way out the door.\nFAQ\nHow can I store more in a small space?\nThere are lots of ways to make the most of small storage spaces, such as utilizing wall and ceiling space, installing pull-out drawers in your cabinets, and sorting goods into categories to streamline your storage solutions.\nHow can I declutter storage areas?\nStorage areas can be an intimidating decluttering project, so it's best to split it into more manageable chunks. Declutter one storage drawer or one closet at a time. Think about what you've used in the past year and what you haven't. Consider whether it's something you could easily replace if you did happen to need it again in the future.\nHow do you create more shelf space for storage?\nTo make the most of shelf space, use organizers and boxes to create neat arrangements that stay in place. Look for boxes you can stack or easy access bins. The easier it is to keep a shelf organized, the more space you'll have."

These are available around the world, although you may need to go to the store to pick up some orders.\nIKEA pieces often require some assembly, which is one way that they keep costs low. The included instructions are helpful to put your fixture together. There are also plenty of tutorials on the IKEA website and professional assembly and installation are available for an extra cost in some cases.\nStyles tend to be minimalist and modern. There are also plenty of options made with textured materials like rattan.\nIKEA also prioritizes sustainability when they source its materials and design fixtures, accessories, and furniture.

Wondering where to start? It would be best if you chose your light fixture based on the size of the room and the furniture in it, says Sheva Knopfler, co-founder of Lights.com.\nThis can mean one statement piece or multiple smaller ones. Over a kitchen island, for example, you may choose one large fixture or multiple smaller fixtures.\nIt can be helpful to look for a place to buy lighting fixtures that carries multiple brands, like Lamps Plus or Wayfair. It provides plenty of options at a variety of price points. However, if you want something with more consistent quality, consider West Elm, Pottery Barn, or another retailer that suits your style and designs their own pieces.\nDelivery and Installation Options\nMany lighting fixtures can be delivered right to your door or to a nearby store for pickup. Smaller fixtures, including table lamps and outstanding floor lamps, typically don’t need professional installation. Even some installed lighting is simple enough for those with basic knowledge of their electrical system to DIY the install.\nAssembly-required pieces, like those from IKEA, tend to be the most affordable but will take some extra work to put together. If you aren’t sure, however, it’s best to have a professional take care of installation.\nReturn Policy\nMake sure that you do plenty of research on the electricity requirements before you purchase a light fixture to ensure that it works with your setup. Photos and reviews can be helpful in determining if the fixture will look the same in an actual room as it does in the ads.\nWayfair and West Elm both have helpful reviews with photos under most fixtures. Large retailers, including Target, The Home Depot, and Lowe’s, have a lot of brick-and-mortar stores which can make returns faster.\nFAQ\nHow big should a ceiling light be?\nWhen selecting a new light fixture, consider the size of the room and where it is placed. There are many factors to consider, like the height of the ceiling, the placement of the light, and the quantity of fixtures you are looking for. If you are choosing a chandelier over the table, it should be about ⅔ the width of the table. Pendant lights, if hung in multiples, should measure to be ⅓ the size of the table.\nWhat is the best ceiling light material?\nSteel and metal are popular choices because they are durable and can have different finishes to complement your look. Wood and glass look great with classic or coastal style. Some specialty materials, such as natural stone, crystal, or even shells, make a big impact. These are often harder to find and come with a big price tag as well.\nWhat wattage should ceiling lights be?\nWhen selecting a ceiling light, it’s important to pay attention to the actual light output. This is especially true if it is the primary way to illuminate your space. “The wattage of your ceiling light depends on the amount of natural light the room receives, as well as what other lighting you may already have in the space. Generally, 60-75 watts should be sufficient for your ceiling light,” says Knopfler. A dimmable fixture can provide options for ambiance.\nWhy Trust The Spruce?\nThis article was researched and written by Mia Ingui, a shopping editor for The Spruce specializing in home decor. Mia is currently buying light fixtures to replace every builder-grade option in her new home, so she has a ton of first-hand experience finding the best places to shop.\nWhen putting together this list, she considered the most popular retailers with a variety of fixtures at different price points. She also looked for places with helpful search tools and customer reviews.\nOur Expert:\nSheva Knopfler, co-founder of Lights.com"

  "articleText": "HOME DESIGN & DECORATING ROOM DESIGN OUTDOOR SPACES\n30 Front Yard Fence Ideas for a Warm Welcome to Your Home\nBy MELISSA EPIFANO\nUpdated on 09/13/24\nMarie Flanigan Interiors\nWhile the first taste of your interior design style often begins at the front door, a front yard fence is an even sooner chance to welcome yourself and visitors home.\nThe idea of poring through fence and gate options might not sound very thrilling, but nowadays, there are types of fences that uphold high design standards and look impeccable once they're sitting pretty in your yard.\nRead on for front yard fence ideas that'll suit any home aesthetic.\nHow to Choose a Great Front Yard Fence\nRafi Friedman, the CEO of Coastal Luxury Outdoors, notes that front yard fences are usually much more about accent and decoration than they are about actually providing security and privacy.\n\"I'm a big fan of more rustic looks for the front,\" he says. For example, stone and wood fences with natural finishes stand out from the white picket crowd.\nWhile the primary purpose of a fence may have shifted for some, you'll find numerous choices that satisfy either the style or security aspect—and often, both.\n01\nof 30\nFrame the Driveway\nMaite Granda\nDriveways that point directly at the house create a perfect sightline to frame your home. By installing a fence that stops at either side of the driveway, you create a pleasing look that feels intentional and guides the eye right to your front door. This can be done with a charming white picket fence or even something more colorful.\nContinue to 2 of 30 below\n02\nof 30\nGo for a Modern Wooden Fence\n@fredricksonlandscapeinc / Instagram\nWooden fences might sound rustic or traditional, but when done well, they can be the perfect addition to more modern houses, too. Laid on top of jet-black rails and spaced further apart than a more classic fence, wooden pickets with blunt, squared-off ends are a sleek and innovative way to balance the earthy look of wood and the starkness of black iron. Plus, it provides privacy that still feels light.\nContinue to 3 of 30 below\n03\nof 30\nOpt for a Stone Fence or Wall\n@dilly.shacks / Instagram\nA stunning stone fence can be a gorgeous way to add security and a statement to your home. While it can easily look stately or formal, there are also ways to keep it more cool and casual, like this fence that has a coastal look. Although it's a heavy-duty material, a collage of lighter-toned rocks is inviting. With the help of a few plants, you can activate vacation mode at your own place.\nContinue to 4 of 30 below\n04\nof 30\nCreate Chic Contrast Between Fence and Home\n@frontporchproperties / Instagram\nBreezy, light homes typically keep the theme running with a bright white fence, but here's your sign to try something a little different. A black or charcoal gray fence is instantly more intriguing. Choosing opposite colors offers major contrast, but they play nicely off one another. Mimic the tone of your home in the dark color that you choose—this one echoes the cool blue and cool white on the house.\nContinue to 5 of 30 below\n05\nof 30\nGo for a Cohesive Built-In Fence\nMarie Flanigan Interiors\nFront yard fences don't have to be at the very front of the property line. You have a whole yard to experiment with. Depending on the style of house, a built-in fence that matches the housing material can be a gorgeous choice and one that looks reminiscent of old Italian villas. It gives much more privacy and gives an unbeatable sense of cohesion.\nContinue to 6 of 30 below\n06\nof 30\nBlend Two Materials in Your Fence\nMarie Flanigan Interiors\nA fence that matches the house is a nice little burst of consistency, but adding in a second material can provide a chic visual break. For instance, try adding wooden doors between stone walls. This helps frame the entrance, but the rustic warmth of the wood complements the warmth of the natural stone.\nContinue to 7 of 30 below\n07\nof 30\nCreate Planters Within the Barrier\nWhite Sands Design | Build\nThere are very few instances where a plant won't make a space more inviting. If your gates or fences feel sterile and plain, built-in planters or botanicals growing around the fence can infuse welcoming energy. This is great for dwellers who may not have a large front yard to work with. You can swap out the plants with the season, making sure they always add an inviting touch.\nContinue to 8 of 30 below\n08\nof 30\nChoose a Fun Pattern for Your Gate\nMichelle Boudreau Design\nWant your fence to feel less like a blockade? Break up bold colors or stark materials with a fun pattern. It doesn't have to vary wildly from the original material, but just enough to lighten things up. Minimal circles, wavy grates, or chevrons may be all that's needed to elevate it.\nContinue to 9 of 30 below\n09\nof 30\nMatch the Exterior of Your House\nLeclair Decor\nThere's really two ways you can take a front yard fence. It can stand out from the house or blend in (and in some cases, a little of both). For a clean, streamlined appearance, opt for a fence made of the same stones, wood, or composite as the house. This creates a sleek, modern look that won't distract from the overall look of your home.\nContinue to 10 of 30 below\n10\nof 30\nAdd a Fence Made of Plants\nWhite Sands Design | Build\nNot everyone loves the look of a fence, and that's where hedges come in. They're a natural way to give some protection and privacy to this part of your space. There's no shortage of types to choose from, whether you prefer tiny-leafed boxwood or Arborvitae trees. There are even gorgeous flowering shrubs, such as mountain laurels, to use.\nContinue to 11 of 30 below\n11\nof 30\nSet the Fence Further Back\nIsland Thatch\nWhile many front yard fences sit further in front of the house, it might be more functional for you to have the fence attached to your home and wrap around. This type is ideal for anyone with backyard areas they'd like to keep sectioned off or who would rather let their front yard shine, but still wants to create privacy.\nContinue to 12 of 30 below\n12\nof 30\nMake the Fence a Statement\nMichelle Boudreau Design\nThere are many ways you can turn a front yard fence into a statement. One such way is using a thick, solid wall in one color with very little details. This provides total privacy but also creates a modern look. People will wonder what type of stunning house is hiding behind the formidable, minimalist wall.\nContinue to 13 of 30 below\n13\nof 30\nInstall a Slide Gate\nWhite Sands Design | Build\nExtra privacy and security doesn't have to look dull or intimidating. If you'd prefer your home to retain its chic energy and welcoming exterior, there are plenty of stylish options for gating your driveway and front yard area, such as a modern sliding fence that matches the color palette of your home.\nContinue to 14 of 30 below\n14\nof 30\nGo for Traditional Pickets\nFantastic Frank\nWhen you hear the words \"front yard fence,\" a white picket likely comes to mind, and for good reason. It's a classic that works with various home types, whether you prefer a traditional look, own a Colonial-style house, or are aiming for a coastal theme. They're not all the same either—you can find variations in height of post, types of picket, and color.\nContinue to 15 of 30 below\n15\nof 30\nChoose a Low-Profile Fence\nBlanco Bungalow\nFences aren't necessarily just for security or privacy, as mentioned. Sometimes they can be a great stylistic addition. A low-profile fence that matches the same build materials as your home can be a chic way to draw a visual perimeter around your property. It's a great way to keep a garden contained, too.\nContinue to 16 of 30 below\n16\nof 30\nUse the Architecture to Inform Your Fence Choice\nMary Patton Design\nThere's nothing wrong with choosing any fence you like the look of, but sometimes the style of your home can be the perfect starting point. Whether it's Craftsman, ranch, Colonial, Victorian, midcentury, or farmhouse, the features and architectural structure can point you in the direction of a matching fencing.\nContinue to 17 of 30 below\n17\nof 30\nPlace White Picket Around the Perimeter\nThistlewood Farms\nIf you really adore the look of a white picket fence, don't just dot one side of your home with this type. Use it to frame the perimeter of your entire front yard. Not only does it look well-designed, but it's a practical option for homeowners with pets or kids that they want to keep safely inside the yard.\nContinue to 18 of 30 below\n18\nof 30\nAdd More Privacy to Your Yard\n©Studio One-One / Getty Images\nFor more privacy, you'll want to avoid pickets with ample space between each. Instead, fences with taller heights and a peek-free alignment are a good bet, or top off your fencing with privacy hedges for a cottage feel.\nContinue to 19 of 30 below\n19\nof 30\nGet Creative With Narrow Spaces\nWhite Sands Design | Build\nEven homes in neighborhoods that stand nearly shoulder to shoulder have room for a front fence—it just takes a little thinking outside of the box. Rather than having a fence run in front of your abode, a fence that runs parallel in the front area and links up with a gate looks good. It's a nice chance to incorporate a rustic accent material as well.\nContinue to 20 of 30 below\n20\nof 30\nStick With Classic Black and White\nDaniel Cabrera, Sell My House Fast SA TX\nA black-and-white color palette remains a tried-and-true favorite. It always looks modern and clean. If your home has a classic look and crisp, neutral color, consider a front yard fence that does the same. It could be a black iron gate or a white picket fence—either way, it'll fit in seamlessly.\nContinue to 21 of 30 below\n21\nof 30\nCreate a Gate for a Courtyard\nMichelle Boudreau Design\nEven if you don't have a true front yard, you can still use a fence and gate system for privacy, protection, and style. A courtyard area is a lovely way to create more usable space and it can all be protected with a sleek fence. The color, shape, and material of the rails and handles can be tailored to the home. This one has a modern, minimalist look.\nContinue to 22 of 30 below\n22\nof 30\nFence With a Bright Color\nDazey Den\nA traditional white fence is always nice, but there's something to be said for taking a small design risk and brightening up your front yard fence. We'd argue it always pays off. Whether it's tangerine or electric teal, a punch color in the front hints that the design inside will be just as fun.\nContinue to 23 of 30 below\n23\nof 30\nBlend the Fence In With Your Home\nDesign by Emily Henderson / Photo by Sara Ligorria-Tramp\nIn some scenarios, you want a fence, but aren't in love with the look of it. This is where paint and plants can go a long way. Lacquer up the pickets so they match the color of your house (or its accent colors) and allow your garden to engulf it a little bit. The result is a virtually a fortified hedge.\nContinue to 24 of 30 below\n24\nof 30\nTry a Clean Black Iron Gate\nInterior Design by Colleen Simonds / Emily Gilbert Photography\nIf picket or composite fences are a little too opaque but you appreciate sleek and streamlined, look to iron gates. They're durable, modern, and visually pleasing thanks to their symmetry, thin rails, and fail-proof color. Like other types of fences, they offer quite a few post and rail arrangements.\nContinue to 25 of 30 below\n25\nof 30\nKeep the Pattern Consistent\nHannah Tyler Designs\nHomes with railings on their front porches or upper balconies offer up the perfect opportunity for a matching moment. Aim to select a front yard fence with the same material, color, and pattern or orientation of rails. This creates a very satisfying end result where the entirety of the property looks cohesive.\nContinue to 26 of 30 below\n26\nof 30\nInvest in Intricate Fence Details\n@ladylandscape / Instagram\nFences, gates, and their doors don't need to be boring. An intricately detailed door with lasered-in shapes or unique cut-outs can be the touch of style your yard needs. Even pickets arranged in chevrons or angled lines can spice up a front yard fence. This is a helpful idea for homeowners who feel underwhelmed by plain vertical pickets or the menacing idea of an impenetrable wall wrapped around their home.\nContinue to 27 of 30 below\n27\nof 30\nCreate Multiple Eye-Catching Levels\nThe Home Consultant\nA fence can lead visitors to the front door, but it doesn't have to be your standard direct route. A little bit of zig-zagging and a play around with levels and layers takes a front yard from basic to beautifully designed. Don't leave the structure to do the work alone—plants, outdoor lights, and rustic tiles can all contribute to this very stylish presentation.\nContinue to 28 of 30 below\n28\nof 30\nSection Off Your Porch Area\n@weremodelit / Instagram\nFences can also be used to cordon off areas of your front yard. They're not only built for perimeters and separating the front and back yards. A house-matching fence can be a nice way to section off the front porch, a patio area, or an indoor/outdoor room so that it's completely consistent with your home's look.\nContinue to 29 of 30 below\n29\nof 30\nTry a Mini Built-In Fence\nThe Home Consultant\nIf you like the look of your front yard sans fence, a built-in fence hugging the sides of your porch or front entryway is the perfect solution. It doesn't block any views and it leaves the fence wrapping for the back portion of your home. Pick a color and structural style that matches your home for the best fit.\nContinue to 30 of 30 below\n30\nof 30\nFence in Your Front Porch\n@kirsten.diane / Instagram\nFencing in your porch can be more cost-effective and it might be the look you're trying to achieve rather than gating off the entirety of your front yard. This can be a nice look for farmhouses and even ranch-style homes that might feel overpowered by a full fence setup, yet it still creates privacy and cohesive look.\n57 Backyard Decor Ideas to Spruce Up Your Outdoor Space"

You’ll be supporting a small business and saving some dough at the same time.\nEtsy's general furniture category alone has almost half a million items, but it is a great place to shop for vintage furniture full of character. You can also find modern styles, more minimalist pieces, mid-century modern, and more. There's also a great selection for DIY additions like knobs and hairpin table legs if you want to upgrade any of your current pieces.\nWhile Etsy is full of wonderful small businesses, it's always best to research and avoid fake product listings or storefronts. Shipping times will also vary based on each shop's size and capacity.\nShades of the Wood Nesting Coffee Table\n$159 at Etsy\nTimber And Whiskey Rustic Coffee Table\n$204 at Etsy\nEleven Southend Waterfall Console Table\n$499 at Etsy\nReclaimlab Co Upcycled Dresser\n$382 at Etsy\nWalmart\nWalmart\nBuy on Walmart\nWalmart has stepped up its home furnishings game—and that includes offering chic furniture at nice prices. We love that you can head to your local store and check options out in person, but they also have an expansive selection online, where you’re sure to find the right fit for your style.\nIn many cities, you can head to the closest Walmart location and check out the furniture in person. With many items offering 90-day returns, you'll have ample time to try an item before deciding it's for you.\nJust note that products that have been delivered or picked up from a store have to be returned to the store. And for products that aren't sold directly from Walmart, the return policies can be different, so it's always great to read the fine print.\nMr. Kate Roxanne Metal Platform Bed Frame\n$332 at Walmart\nHomall 35\" Round Coffee Table\n$170\n$120 at Walmart\nBest Choice Products 5-Piece Wooden Modern Dining Set\n$450 at Walmart\nAnyrose Arched Full Length Mirror\n$49 at Walmart\nIKEA\nIkea\nBuy on Ikea\nAh, IKEA.

You're still more likely to find those deals in brick-and-mortar locations, but the e-commerce site also has a steady supply of online bargains—especially on ottomans or storage solutions.\nYou can find ottomans and poufs for less than $50 and in fun colors and prints. Many are handcrafted and have beautiful woven details that add texture to a room.\nUnderstandably, the quantities of these affordable goods can be quite limited, so you'll need to commit to your purchase quickly. For some larger items, the shipping returns have a surcharge, and items returned in stores have a return window of up to 40 days after purchase.\nJofran Wood Accent Tables\nView on TJ Maxx\nJamie Young Company Faux Shagreen Console Table\nView on TJ Maxx\nLillian August Scalloped Console Table\nView on TJ Maxx\nDexter Bolter Curved Back Dining Chair\nView on TJ Maxx\nBob's Discount Furniture\nBob's Furniture\nBuy on Mybobs.com\nBob’s goes far beyond the showroom now with a sleek selection of furniture online, too.

The best part: shipping is included on most items.\nThis nationwide retailer, which sells online and in stores, offers ways to deliver furniture to your home, and the living room sets are great options. You can search for pieces based on material, the number of seats, and even arm styles. The coordinated sets often come in solid, classic hues like black, tan, or navy, but there are some occasional prints.\nWhile shopping, you might notice the option to add on Goof Proof protection. This five-year warranty can range from $40 to $400, depending on the price of the actual furniture.

They carry name brands at a fraction of the price, and as a member, you’ll have access to all of them, from mattresses to sofas to outdoor dining tables.\nIf you're in the market for a large leather sectional, there are dozens of options for buttery soft brown, beige, and black leather couches. Some of them look quite similar, but the \"compare product\" feature makes it a bit easier to narrow down choices.\nWhile membership is necessary to shop in stores, anyone can shop for furniture via the Costco website, with a few pieces reserved solely for members.\nLila Nightstand\nView on Costco.com\nRylee Fabric Counter Stool, 2-Pack\nView on Costco.com\nElena Sofa Table & Two Ottomans\nView on Costco.com\nGreyson 32\" Modular Console\nView on Costco.com\nHow We Picked Our Retailers\nWe researched dozens of retailers that offer budget furniture for all rooms of the house, have quality materials, and include easy delivery options at checkout.\nWe also consulted interior designers Wilfredo Emanuel and Kim Frencho for their best tips for buying budget recliners and other wallet-friendly furniture. They shared some excellent insights, including what to avoid and how to tell when a piece is made with high-quality materials.\nWhat to Look for When Buying Budget Furniture\nA Comprehensive Inventory Size\nThere’s nothing more inconvenient than shopping in-store or online at a retailer that only sells a particular type of furniture. When shopping around for budget furniture, a large, diverse inventory ensures you can easily narrow down what you like and don't like as well.\nOur list includes retailers specializing in one decor style and others offering various furniture styles. Larger retailers like Walmart have pieces for the bedroom, living room, outdoor spaces, and more. This is great if you don’t want to visit multiple stores or incur shipping fees from different retailers.\nHowever, if you want to design a room around a specific piece of furniture, we recommend researching retailers with unique offerings in that category. We love All Modern because it sells mid-century modern and contemporary furniture at reasonable prices.\nA Flexible Return Policy\nShopping for furniture, especially if you’re doing so online, can come with challenges. Making returns has to be one of the biggest hassles. That’s why it’s important to find a reputable retailer and read the return policy (especially look at the fine print).\nSome retailers make returns a breeze with free pickups from your home, but other experiences might be less convenient if you have to re-package and return a large item like a dining room table or sofa. Not only can this feel like a hassle, but it can be quite expensive, which makes that affordable piece of furniture quite costly.\nDespite being known for challenging assembly instructions, Ikea offers the best return policy on our list with 180 days on used items. This means that you can return items that have already been painstakingly assembled if you decide they're not a fit for your home.\nSimple, Straightforward Delivery and Assembly\nMany retailers advertise free shipping for most furniture, but that’s not always available. Before checking out online, calculate your shipping costs, which usually entails entering your delivery zip code. Some businesses will charge a flat fee, while others base the total delivery cost on weight or order amount.\nAssembly is another issue to factor in. A store like Ikea is known for keeping prices low, but you assemble the furniture yourself. You can pay an extra fee for a third party to assemble furniture and some stores like Bob’s Discount offer white-glove service.  \n\"The key to shopping affordably is to be selective and look for items that are made with better materials so that they last longer,\" Emanuel says. This means avoiding pieces made from thin particleboard and sticking with solid wood (when available) and metal-reinforced frames.\nFAQ\nWhen’s the best time to buy furniture?\nJust like purchasing outerwear or a swimsuit, certain times of the year are just better than others when it comes to buying furniture. January and July can be great times to find great deals before new styles are released. And, of course, there are holidays like Memorial Day and Fourth of July where shoppers can save more than 20 percent on some furniture.\nWhen on a budget, is it better to opt for new or used furniture?\nThe choice to buy new or used furniture can come down to budget, but also personal style. Buying new pieces can provide a more immediate solution if you know exactly what you’re looking for and have a specific type of furniture in mind, like a modular sofa that perfectly complements your existing decor. That same amazing piece can be found used, but it might take a bit more time to find just what you’re looking for. However, if you’re not beholden to a specific timetable, you can absolutely find used furniture that ranges from a functional, classic piece to a decor stunner that makes any space pop.\nHow can you make furniture look more expensive?\nOne of the easiest ways to make furniture look more expensive is to add in the high and low mix, whether that means actual pieces or even material choice. A few stylish pillows or a throw blanket in materials like velvet or super soft fleece can make a wallet-friendly couch look way more expensive than its actual price tag.\nWhy Trust The Spruce?\nThis article was written by Mia Ingui, an editor at The Spruce. She recently just purchased her first home, and because of that, is desperately looking for ways to furnish it without emptying her savings. She has shopped at several of these retailers and has first-hand experience testing and building furniture to give them her stamp of approval.\nOur Experts:\nWilfredo Emanuel, interior designer\nKim Frencho, interior designer\nEmma Phelps, associate editor at The Spruce"

Adding a pot filler on the wall above your espresso maker is another option.\nHow tall should a coffee bar be?\nA home coffee bar that is counter height (typically 36”) will be convenient to use and be easily integrated into your kitchen, butler’s pantry, or walk-in pantry. \n23 Mug Storage Ideas to Help You Stay Organized"

  "articleText": "CLEANING & ORGANIZING ORGANIZING BATHROOM ORGANIZATION\n43 Bathroom Storage Ideas to Maximize Space and Style\nBy GRACE GALLAGHER\nUpdated on 12/23/22\nDesign by Cathie Hong Interiors / Margaret Austin Photo\nBecause of their smaller size, bathrooms can be a great place to try out daring decor trends like bold tile or colorful wallpaper. At the same time, because washrooms are not typically very large (at least not in relation to the other rooms in your home), they can accumulate clutter quickly, even if you've made the most of smart bathroom organization ideas. (All the organization hacks in the world can't help if you don't have enough storage, after all.)\nFortunately for bathrooms that are bursting at the seams, these bathroom storage ideas will help you fit all those must-have bathroom toiletries, but still have room for details like plants, candles, or art.\n01\nof 43\nUse a Storage Ladder for Towels\nTwelve On Main\nA storage ladder brings a rustic touch to any room, but it works especially well in a small bathroom when designed to fit over the toilet, an area which is often just wasted space. This ladder from Twelve on Main is actually a DIY project (for just $10, too). In addition to towels, hanging a wire basket from one of the rungs is a clever way to increase storage.\n02\nof 43\nHang a Magnetic Strip\nDarkroom & Dearly\nA magnetic knife rack may not seem like it belongs in a bathroom, but this simple idea from Darkroom & Dearly is a great way to make the most of blank wall space. Stick anything from tweezers to nail clippers and bobby pins to the bar, which will keep countertops clear and prevent the rust stains that happen when metal clips get wet.\n03\nof 43\nUse a Wire Basket for Hot Tools\nDream Green DIY\nWhether your bathroom is large or tiny, it always seems difficult to find a place to store cumbersome blow dryers, straighteners, and curling irons. This smart storage solution from Dream Green DIY hangs a wire file box to the side of the sink to keep hot tools organized without using up precious drawer space.\n04\nof 43\nMake Use of Under-Sink Space\nA Beautiful Mess\nThe space under the sink can become cluttered quickly, especially since the pipes make it such an oddly shaped spaced. Enter under-sink storage ideas like these metal baskets from A Beautiful Mess in various sizes keep washcloths, extra products, and brushes organized in a cabinet and out of sight.\nContinue to 5 of 43 below\n05\nof 43\nGo Wide\nDesign by Cathie Hong Interiors / Margaret Austin Photo\nAn extra-wide leaning ladder with a black finish adds storage for extra towels, toiletries, and even a cute little shower companion plant in this modern California bathroom from Cathie Hong Interiors.\n06\nof 43\nUse Modular Drawer Organizers\n@neatbymeg / Instagram\nShallow vanity drawers like this one from @neatbymeg can benefit from modular organizing bins to keep everyday items handy. Get a variety of sizes to keep products stored properly, and you'll know exactly where to find everything on rushed mornings.\n07\nof 43\nAdd a Leaning Bookshelf\nBang On Style\nA narrow bookcase can be used to keep towels and products organized, plus it's a way to style the bathroom with candles and plants without it looking cluttered. This leaning shelf from Bang On Style has the look of a chic ladder, but with more function because it has deeper shelves.\n08\nof 43\nInstall Over-the-Toilet Built-Ins\nThe Merrythought\nContrasting colors add dimension to a space, which can make it look bigger and brighter. In this mini bathroom makeover from The Merrythought, the farmhouse shelves pop against the forest green wall that's just the right width for storing a Mason jar full of cotton buds or a pot of makeup brushes.\nContinue to 9 of 43 below\n09\nof 43\nUse Clear Storage Bins\n@breathing.room.organization / Instagram\nClear storage bins have taken pantries by storm, but they work equally well in bathrooms. These see-through bins from @breathing.room.organization are aesthetically pleasing, but they also allow you to easily see what you have so you don't have to go digging.\n10\nof 43\nMix Open and Closed Storage\nDesign by Cathie Hong Interiors / Margaret Austin Photo\nIn this bathroom from Cathie Hong Interiors, an oversized mirrored cabinet over the sink includes open shelving in golden-toned wood that provides space for display and storage of everyday items. Using one large piece of furniture helps to make the space feel larger and gives the wall anchoring the vanity and adjacent toilet a cohesive feel.\n11\nof 43\nLabel Bins for Small Essentials\nThe Creativity Exchange\nYou can take those pretty clear storage bins to the next level by adding printable labels like these from The Creativity Exchange. It looks cute, but more importantly, it helps maintain your storage system by giving everything an easy-to-find designated spot.\n12\nof 43\nHack a Bathroom Ladder\nThistlewood Farms\nThis IKEA hack from Thistlewood Farms for a compact towel rack and shelf system may be based on a discontinued item, but you could apply the same thinking to many types of racks.

This Mason jar organizer from The DIY Playbook is a fun project that looks rustic and adds a point of interest to the bathroom while helping keep smaller, loose items neatly stored.\n15\nof 43\nMake It Multifunctional\nAlmost Makes Perfect\nIf you're renovating a bathroom with added storage in mind, an easy upgrade is to look for medicine cabinets that have both a mirror, closed storage, and an open bottom shelf, like this one from Almost Makes Perfect, to keep the products you reach for daily organized and easy to find.\n16\nof 43\nGo Low\nStudio DIY\nStorage baskets are a cute way to store anything from throw blankets to kids' toys, but they also work well in the bathroom. The woven bins in this bathroom from Studio DIY are an easy and neat way to store extra towels, washcloths, and loose items, and it's an especially brilliant idea in a kids' bathroom, because no one will know (or care) if nothing is folded.\nOne Thing Ep 83: This Small Space Bathroom Storage Solution is a Game Changer\nContinue to 17 of 43 below\n17\nof 43\nAdd Shallow Storage\nThe Creativity Exchange\nIf you keep your extra products in a linen or bathroom closet, you know how hard they can be to find (and so you may end up buying something you already have that's just out of sight). This shallow closet from The Creativity Exchange is a clever way to see everything you have, and it blends into what would otherwise be a blank wall.\n18\nof 43\nOrganize Drawers With Spacers\n@neatbymeg / Instagram\nIt's easy to let a deep drawer become a graveyard for old products and expired sunscreen. But drawers are some of the most prime real estate in a small bathroom, and dividers like these from @neatbymeg help keep everything neatly in its place—and can help you store more than you ever imagined.\n19\nof 43\nBring in a Small Storage Table\nBlack & Blooms\nThere is so much to love about this lively yet serene bathroom from Black & Blooms: the small table that serves as a spot for candles and crystals but also towels; the hanging shelf; the beautiful bath. Keep a bathtub caddy set up across your soaking tub at all times if you need a little extra surface space.\n20\nof 43\nUse Trays\nDesign by Cathie Hong Interiors / Margaret Austin Photo\nThere's nothing wrong with keeping a few well chosen daily essentials out on the countertop for convenience and to keep your bathroom looking lived in and vibrant. In this California bathroom from Cathie Hong Interiors, mismatched trays are used to corral items on the countertop, keeping items separated and preventing them from looking jumbled. You can keep the trays low key or think of each one as a mini vignette where you can organize your grooming routine and embellish as desired with cut flowers, scented candles, or anything else that makes you feel relaxed.\nContinue to 21 of 43 below\n21\nof 43\nRepurpose a Glass Bookshelf\nLia Griffith\nA tall slim bookcase is a wonderful way to add storage to a smaller bathroom, like this one from Lia Griffith. Pick shelves that are wide and tall enough for perfectly folded towels, and use a wicker basket for rolled up washcloths.\n22\nof 43\nRethink Toothbrush Storage\nLiving Well Mom\nIf you're tired of the toothbrushes taking up counter space (and creating crusty puddles on the vanity), then this is genius solution from Living Well Mom keeps everything organized and out of sight. You could even add velcro strips to the cups and inside the cabinet door so kids can pull out their whole cup when it's time to brush.\n23\nof 43\nStore Tires in Wire Baskets\nLovely Indeed\nRolling towels into logs and storing them in a basket of your choosing will save space and look homey and warm, like this wire basket full of striped towels from Lovely Indeed.\n24\nof 43\nConsider Dual Storage Options\nThe Merrythought\nHanging towels from a ladder helps save space in your linen closet and on any bathroom shelves. If there's room, a ladder next to a shelf is a great way to make the most of a small space (and add plenty of storage potential), like this apartment bathroom from The Merrythought.\nContinue to 25 of 43 below\n25\nof 43\nFloat a Shelf Above the Tub\n@milkandhoneylife / Instagram\nThis farmhouse style bathroom from @milkandhoneylife looks minimalist while still being full of detail. Space above a tub is often underused, and it's a perfect spot to hang an extra long floating shelf. Another smart bit of storage are the hanging wire baskets that descend from the ceiling; they look airy and interesting but can hold towels.\n26\nof 43\nUse Matching Tones\nDesign by Cathie Hong Interiors / Margaret Austin Photo\nDon't forget to add storage to display favorite items, decor, or the gorgeous packaging that convinced you to buy those self-care products in the first place. In this bathroom from Cathie Hong Interiors, black metal floating shelves with a slim profile keep special lotions and potions on display while blending in with the black plumbing fixtures and accents throughout the space for a seamless and cohesive look.\n27\nof 43\nPick a Vanity With Open Shelving\nSugar & Cloth\nNot only is the walnut wood of this bathroom vanity stunning, but it also offers a ton of storage because it includes both shelves and drawers. This beautiful setup from Sugar & Cloth makes a good case for installing a larger vanity, even if you have a single sink.\n28\nof 43\nInstall a Narrow Hanging Shelf\nDesign by Cathie Hong Interiors / Margaret Austin Photo\nEven if you're tight on space, you can still find room for a narrow shelf. This one from Cathie Hong Interiors has cool industrial vibes, and while it may not be very wide, it has plenty of space for storing products, candles, perfume, plants, or other things that are functional as well as decorative.\nContinue to 29 of 43 below\n29\nof 43\nMake the Most of the Vanity\nSugar & Cloth\nA large vanity like this one from Sugar & Cloth is the easiest path to chic bathroom storage. Find one that fits your vibe, and make the most of it by putting in drawers or shelves that are deep enough for towels, products, and all your other must-haves.\n30\nof 43\nGo Incognito\nA Beautiful Mess\nAdd a print onto the front of a narrow storage cabinet to maximize space without having mirrors on every wall, like this cool incognito medicine cabinet from A Beautiful Mess. There's no rule saying there has to be just one medicine cabinet per bathroom, especially when you need all the storage you can get.\n31\nof 43\nUse Baskets for Clunky Products\nStudio DIY\nUse boho style storage baskets on open shelving to hide clunky products like this pink and green bathroom from Studio DIY.\n32\nof 43\nMaximize Every Inch\nDesign by Cathie Hong Interiors / Margaret Austin Photo\nWhen choosing a bathroom vanity for an existing alcove of any size, be sure to run it from wall to wall in order to maximize every last inch of storage space while achieving a tailored custom look, like this bathroom from Cathie Hong Interiors.\nContinue to 33 of 43 below\n33\nof 43\nInstall Built-in Shelving\nLia Griffith\nBuilt-ins are a great way to maximize space in any bathroom, whether it be big or smaller. This guest bathroom from Lia Griffith doesn't have a vanity, but there's plenty of storage with the built-in shelves and lower cabinet.\n34\nof 43\nHang It Up\nDesign by Cathie Hong Interiors / Christy Q. Photography\nIn this long railway-style bathroom from Cathie Hong Interiors, a garden tub occupies the space beneath the window, while a floating shelf holds art and bath salts and some simple wall hooks make it easy to hang up quick-drying, lightweight Turkish towels once your bubble bath is over.\n35\nof 43\nDIY Some Shelves\nThe Merrythought\nDon't forget to look up when considering bathroom storage. Often, one of the best spots for floating shelves is on the forgotten space above the toilet. These DIY bathroom shelves from The Merrythought were made out of wood that can be stained any color that you like, and then it's up to you to decide what to store on your new bathroom shelves.\n36\nof 43\nBuild a Ledge\nDesign by Cathie Hong Interiors / Margaret Austin Photo\nA terracotta tile ledge in this Japandi-style bathroom from Cathie Hong Interiors hides plumbing while adding interest and providing a open storage for shampoo, soap, conditioner, and whatever else you need to get through a shower or bath. Just be sure that open storage doesn't get too cluttered lest it ruin the zen vibes.\nContinue to 37 of 43 below\n37\nof 43\nUse Deep Drawers for Haircare\n@afreshnest / Instagram\nIf you're lucky enough to have deep drawers in the bathroom, use them wisely. More shallow drawers are perfect for makeup and smaller items, but a drawer with depth like the one here from @afreshnest is best used for more cumbersome items like blow dryers and hot tools, which are notoriously difficult to store.\n38\nof 43\nCarve It Out\nEmily Henderson Design / Photo by Sara Ligorria-Tramp\nSometimes the best place to look for extra storage is in the empty space behind the walls. In this bathroom from Emily Henderson Design, a niche with open shelving leaves space to store extra towels and display decorative bottles, candles, and even a miniature framed painting to make it both stylish and functional.\n39\nof 43\nAdd an Extra Shelf\nDesign by Cathie Hong Interiors / Margaret Austin Photo\nMake a shower wall niche extra functional by adding a discreet glass shelf where you can float a body brush, razor, pumice stone, or other essential items without cluttering up your minimalist aesthetic, like this bathroom from Cathie Hong Interiors.\n40\nof 43\nHang Shelves Inside the Shower\nLouis Duncan-He Designs / Photo by Eymeric Wildling\nIf you don't have a built-in niche but do have a large walk-in shower, consider hanging floating shelves on the shower wall, like this spacious bathroom from Louis Duncan-He Designs.\nContinue to 41 of 43 below\n41\nof 43\nStack It Up\nEmily Henderson Design / Photo by Sara Ligorria-Tramp\nEmily Henderson Design optimized the space beneath the double vanity in this black and white bathroom by adding stacked wire baskets and a slide-out top shelf that doubles the storage capacity and keeps toiletries and bathroom essentials neat, organized, and easy to find.\n42\nof 43\nBench It\nLouis Duncan-He Designs / Photo by Eymeric Wildling\nAn angled bench in this narrow shower stall from Louis Duncan-He Designs provides storage space for shampoo bottles and a place to sit when you need to slough those dry heels or shave your legs without taking up too much floor or wall space.\n43\nof 43\nUse All Available Real Estate\nEmily Henderson Design / Photo by Sara Ligorria-Tramp\nEmily Henderson Design made a feature of the often overlooked real estate on top of the toilet by placing a woven tray and matching storage baskets that maximize the surface area to provide concealed storage for essentials while adding warmth and texture to the black and white space."

  "articleText": "HOME DESIGN & DECORATING ROOM DESIGN ENTRYWAYS & MUDROOMS\n22 Stunning Entryway Ideas to Make an Impression\nBy DEIRDRE SULLIVAN\nUpdated on 09/12/24\nThe Spruce / Jessica Lombardi\nA beautiful and well-organized entryway is the first place you see when you enter a home. It's your chance to make an impression on guests and set an inviting tone for your home. Whether it's modern, rustic, contemporary, traditional, or mid-century, you can create a striking foyer that is as beautiful as it is functional. You can include dramatic art or a stunning vintage rug just as easily as you can add storage or drop areas that encourage you and others to leave shoes, umbrellas, or other outdoor items.\nTo help you begin decorating your entryway, first consider your design style, then think about adding furniture, decor, and storage to tie it together and make the space work for you. Maybe you want a mirror or a console table, baskets for gloves, or shelving for mail. You could look for a bench to put your shoes on or a rug to catch wet feet.\nNo matter the size, you can create an entryway that maximizes your style and space, and here are 22 of our favorite entryway ideas for inspiration.\n01\nof 22\nCreating an Entryway in an Open Concept Home\nCalimia Home\nInterior designer Amy Fasnacht from Havenly, an online home decorating service, was tasked with transforming an empty, open-concept space without a proper entryway into a multifunctional abode.\nTo accomplish the mission, Fasnacht carved up the room into clearly defined zones for specific purposes. She placed a rough-hewed bench behind the sofa to create a little entryway. The piece of furniture conveniently located near the front door is a landing strip for grab-and-go items, like handbags.\n22 Best Mudroom Bench Ideas for Stylish Storage\nContinue to 2 of 22 below\n02\nof 22\nEfficient Entryway in a Swedish Apartment\nAlvhem\nNot having a closet in the entryway is not a problem for this Swedish apartment seen on Alvhem. A recessed wall deep enough for shelves with a 10-inch depth becomes a handy spot to keep shoes and hang coats. A pendant light, sizeable gilded mirror, and small seat add practical function. On the floor are square ceramic tiles that stand up to wet shoes.\nContinue to 3 of 22 below\n03\nof 22\nFunky Entryway Chairs\nMegan Pflug\nHaving a place to put on or take off shoes in an entryway is essential in many homes. We believe that the bench, chair, or stool you decide to keep near your front door should show off your unique style. Case in point: these Eames-inspired chairs.\nThe molded plastic seats were initially solid blue. Interior designer Megan Pflug gave them a stunning new look with patterned marble fabric. Her decoupage project required three yards of material, which was cut to fit each chair before being attached to the original surface using Mod Podge glue. Afterward, a couple of coats of clear water-based polyurethane were applied to the fabric to protect against moisture and stains.\nContinue to 4 of 22 below\n04\nof 22\nEntryway With Midcentury Furniture\nAmber Interiors\nThe super talented design team at Amber Interiors out of Calabasas, California, gave a tired ranch house a fresh and modern new look. The revamped entryway is 100 percent swoon-worthy.\nAnchoring the space is a gorgeous, oversized mirror reflecting the lovely living room. Below it is a midcentury wood slat bench in teak that provides a place to sit or drop off handbags. A rug brings the room a warming color, and in the corner, there is a pop of natural greenery. On the right is another midcentury seat made of wood with two sheepskin rugs for comfort.\nThe 7 Best Outdoor Rugs of 2024, Tested and Reviewed\nContinue to 5 of 22 below\n05\nof 22\nBlack and White Small Entryway\nJWS Interiors\nThis cute and tiny entryway brimming with style is by Jennifer Wagner Schmidt Interior Design situated in Fairfax, Virginia. The fantastic foyer is equipped with a glossy lacquer console table with drawer storage. Above it is a faux bamboo mirror in white. Dressing up the walls is black and white wallpaper in a modern Moroccan-inspired trellis pattern. Additionally, the framed art is perfect for personalizing a space, for which a small print is added here.\nContinue to 6 of 22 below\n06\nof 22\nBeautiful Porcelain Tile in Hardworking Entryways\nCentered by Design\nDurable, water-resistant flooring is ideal for busy entryways, especially in areas prone to lots of wet weather. That is why Chicago-based interior designer Claire Staszak from Centered by Design installed porcelain tile in an eye-popping pattern in this entryway. Compared to ceramic tile, porcelain is harder and less porous, making it an ideal choice for high-traffic areas.\nContinue to 7 of 22 below\n07\nof 22\nEntryway Solutions for a Long Narrow Hallway\nAlvhemmakleri.se\nIf your entryway is a long, narrow hallway—behold these ingenious tips from a Scandinavian apartment spotted on Alvhem Makleri. On the right, five sets of IKEA shoe cabinets called TRONES are mounted onto the wall. Next to the front door are slate floor tiles that stand up to moisture and dirt. The rug placed on the floor will protect the painted wood floors while also being easy to clean thanks to it being machine-washable.\nNext to the long hallway is the section shown in the right-hand photo. Wall-mounted shelves double as a coat rack and a place to display baskets or bags.\nContinue to 8 of 22 below\n08\nof 22\nElegant Small Entryway in a New York City Apartment\nThe entryway in this New York City apartment decorated by Murphy Deesign almost broke Instagram. The beautiful trellis wallpaper in ginger jar blue is from Black & Spiro in Queensland, Australia. The gorgeous, geometric console is a score from a West Elm sale.

She says it is a particularly handy spot for groceries when unloading the car.\nThe basket under the seat is for hats, scarves, and other outerwear items. The quirky cow and steer coat hooks work with the entryway's southwestern theme. They are also the ideal size for hanging dog leashes and house keys. The eye-catching black and white print on the wall is an engineer print of a photo Gibson took several years ago.\nContinue to 10 of 22 below\n10\nof 22\nColorful Entryway Covered in Tile\nNote Design Studio\nSwedish interior designer Daniel Heckscher from Note Design Studio updated what was once a cookie-cutter apartment foyer into a playful entryway using porcelain tile. Covering the walls and floor created a one-of-a-kind space that is moisture-resistant. The square tiles on the walls create a repeating diamond pattern. On the floor, brick-style tiles are laid out in a herringbone pattern. Grout in contrasting colors enhances both layouts.\nContinue to 11 of 22 below\n11\nof 22\nLittle Entryway in a Stylish Home\nA House in the Hills\nIn this seriously creative home decorated by blogger Sarah Mora, from A House in the Hills, a floating wood console carves out a modestly sized entryway.

Modern trellis wallpaper from York Coverings extending from the floor to the top of the home's second level sets the tone. A natural wood table from the Wicker Emporium is an elegant touch that does not feel overdone. The white scroll mirror and the two knitted pouf stools are stylish and practical pieces from Homesense.\nAll About Modern Farmhouse Style\nContinue to 14 of 22 below\n14\nof 22\nA Console in the Foyer\nK Shan Design\nCreating a beautiful entryway is child's play with these styling tips from the décor experts at Havenly. Their example uses a simple console to establish an attractive focal point for those entering the home, whether it is centered with the front door or up against an adjacent wall.\nWhile the console's primary purpose is to provide a spot to drop keys and bags, it is also an excellent spot for displaying knick-knacks. When decorating your foyer, do not forget about the entryway walls. A mirror surrounded by wall art will make a stellar first impression.\nContinue to 15 of 22 below\n15\nof 22\nA Modern Entryway That Will Inspire You to Be Tidy\nHomepolish\nWe believe a beautifully decorated entryway with lots of practical storage will inspire you to keep things tidy instead of throwing your stuff in a massive heap. This gorgeous foyer by Angela Belt at Homepolish, an interior design company out of New York City, is a great example.\nA porcelain tile floor in a modern black and white pattern is exceptionally welcoming. A vintage shag rug brings room brightening colors while the rustic wood bench provides a place to slip on shoes. The modern wood console adds extra storage space. A black ceramic table lamp offers a soft glow at night when an overhead fixture would be considered too bright.\nThe 7 Best Outdoor Rugs of 2024, Tested and Reviewed\nContinue to 16 of 22 below\n16\nof 22\nMaximizing Vertical Storage\nAlvhem\nA sliver of wall space can expand your storage options in a small apartment.

First, let's talk about storage. A coat rack and console table create room to park scarves, coats, and handbags.\nWhen it comes to style, there are lots of decorative touches that make this foyer welcoming. The turquoise door adds a burst of cheerful color while playing off the framed prints on the wall on the right. The metallic and geometric patterned wallpaper dresses up the ceiling while the star pendant acts as a decorative focal point.\nContinue to 18 of 22 below\n18\nof 22\nEntryway Hack for Growing Families\nCourtesy of Pinterest\nAffordable solutions that maximize function at home are always winning ideas.

On the left wall are Muuto Wood Coatrack Dots. On the right is a wall-mounted storage box for keys, sunglasses, and other small items. On top are a couple of small plants that infuse the space with a little greenery. The mirror above it all helps to brighten the foyer by reflecting sunlight from a nearby window.\nContinue to 20 of 22 below\n20\nof 22\nFaking a Tile Floor in the Entryway\nGrillo Designs\nIt is often challenging for renters to add both style and function to a room since they're usually not allowed to renovate or hang anything on the walls. Medina, the decor blogger from Grillo Designs, came up with a couple of solutions to combat these problems. First, she covered up the existing floor in her entryway with peel and stick vinyl wallpaper. (Bonus: vinyl wallpapers are somewhat water-resistant and can be wiped clean, making them perfect for families with young kids.) Notice the wire magazine rack on the wall? It was installed using a self-adhesive plastic hook.\nContinue to 21 of 22 below\n21\nof 22\nNeutral Entryway Filled With Natural Materials\nStudio McGee\nBeautiful pieces in mostly natural materials are what make this entryway by Studio McGee out of Utah so inviting. The light wood flooring is called Alta Vista Laguna from Hallmark Floors. This stunning console used for keys and bags is a gray-washed Douglas fir. Its natural grain lends a rustic yet sophisticated touch to the foyer. Pairing the unit with a set of woven baskets adds more storage space. To keep everything in the entryway from seeming too matchy-matchy, a brass chandelier was installed overhead for a little contrast.\nContinue to 22 of 22 below\n22\nof 22\nPractical Pieces in an Entryway in a Small Apartment\nHomey Oh My\nSeveral practical pieces helped Amy, the content creator at Homey Oh My, whip up an entryway in a tiny corner of her apartment. To anchor the space, she added a narrow console table ideal for dumping little items like keys and mail. To personalize the nook, she spruced up the table with a ceramic vase and a couple of candlestick holders. The black tray on the right is a catchall for small items like gum, jewelry, and a mini flashlight.

Cubbies for shoes and folded clothes are convenient for extra storage, too.\nHow can you save room in your walk-in closet?\nTake those out-of-season clothes out of the closet and store them in storage bins that fit under the bed.\nHow often should you declutter your closet?\nGo through your clothes and shoes twice a year and donate ones that don't fit or you don't wear any longer. Throw out clothing that is unfit for donating, such as clothes that have holes, stains, or are stretched out.\nLearn More: How to Declutter the Clothes in Your Closet\nHow do you plan a walk-in closet?\nTo plan a walk-in closet, start by decluttering to evaluate your storage needs. Decide how much space you will need to accommodate hanging clothes like jackets and dresses, folded items like sweaters, undergarments, shoes, handbags, and whatever else you own. Depending on whether you plan to DIY it, purchase a prefabricated closet kit, or hire a professional closet designer, the next step is to install it and arrange your wardrobe once it’s done.\nWhat's the difference between a walk-in closet and a walk-in wardrobe?\nA walk-in closet and a walk-in wardrobe are the same thing. Americans commonly use the first term, while Brits use the word “wardrobe” or “cupboard” to describe a closet. A standalone wardrobe is a piece of furniture for storing clothing and accessories in a room without a closet, also known by its French name, the armoire.\nHow much does it cost to build a walk-in closet?\nAccording to HomeAdvisor, the average cost of building a walk-in closet is $2,063. Small custom features may be added for as little as $250, while larger projects can cost more than $20,000. The cost of a walk-in closet will depend on size, the number of custom features such as shelving and storage, and the price of labor and materials in your area.\nThe Decluttering Task You Definitely Need to Do This Fall, Based on Your Zodiac Sign"

  "articleText": "CELEBRATIONS HOLIDAYS & OCCASIONS CHRISTMAS\n46 Christmas Window Decorating Ideas to Add Cheerful Curb Appeal\nSeasonal decor visible from inside and out\nBy ASHLYN NEEDHAM\nUpdated on 09/10/24\nThe Spruce / EE Berger\nThis Christmas season, we're aiming to spread as much holiday cheer as we can—and one spot in the home we're not overlooking is on our windows. Who said they can't be let in on the jolly fun?\nWhile Christmas decor typically finds its place along the tree, tables, and shelves, windows provide an area where decorations can be seen by all, inside and out.\nIf you think Christmas window decorations stop at the traditional wreath, prepare to think again. Here are 46 fun and festive Christmas window decorating ideas to try this year.\n01\nof 46\nBig Bows\nThe Spruce / Carson Downing\nBows are another longstanding traditional Christmas icon, but their placement isn't limited to the Christmas tree. Place big bows along the exterior of your home's windows to up the feel of the holiday and welcome one of the seasonal colors into your outdoor Christmas decoration display.\nChristmas bows can be placed on the windows by themselves or accompany a wreath, as seen in the picture above.\nTip\nThe bows you choose don't have to be solely red—there are plenty of Christmas bows with checkered patterns or other color schemes to choose from.\nContinue to 2 of 46 below\n02\nof 46\nString Lights\nEmily Henderson Design / Photo by Sara Ligorria-Tramp\nString lights are a year-round decorative piece that certainly has its place along your window in the Christmas season. The warm glow provides the right amount of ambiance you can drape from the corners of your windows or line the trim.\nContinue to 3 of 46 below\n03\nof 46\nDisplay Christmas Cards\nDesign by Emily Bowser & Erik Kenneth Staalberg / Photo by Sara Ligoria-Tramp\nUnsure of what to do with your Christmas cards? Instead of throwing them in the trash or hanging them on the fridge, turn them into a DIY garland. This simple approach to Christmas window decor is quick and easy—all you need is string and clothes pins.\nDrape your garland material of choice from one window corner to the other before hanging it with the clothes pins as seen in the picture above. Not only is this a unique placement for your Christmas cards, but it makes them functional as budget-friendly decor pieces.\nContinue to 4 of 46 below\n04\nof 46\nChristmas Wreath Trio\nGolden Boys and Me / Instagram\nWe love symmetry in interior design and we're bringing that love into our Christmas window decorations with a wreath trio. Whether you have three windows by your sink like Jennifer does in the picture above, or one giant window in your home, good things come in three.\nContinue to 5 of 46 below\n05\nof 46\nRibbon-Draped Window Wreaths\nChatfield Court\nLeave no window bare this holiday season. Hang a simple Christmas wreath in each window with the help of ribbons.\nCut a strand of your favorite holiday-themed ribbon (bonus points if it's red and white checkered) before looping the ribbon through the wreath. Tie the ends together before hanging on Command hook or nail to keep the wreath in place until you're ready to take your Christmas decorations down.\nContinue to 6 of 46 below\n06\nof 46\nWindow Swag\nRabbit Hill\nHoliday window swag makes a beautiful arrangement for your exterior windows since it encompasses multiple Christmas elements at once.\nWith its combination of evergreen branches, holly and berries, pinecones, and string lights, you'll have a gorgeous fresh arrangement to decorate your home's exterior.\nMake your arrangement more festive with a neutral checkered ribbon to tie in the center and spread down the sides as seen in the picture above.\nContinue to 7 of 46 below\n07\nof 46\nChristmas Window Boxes\nThe Spruce / EE Berger\nAdd life and holiday cheer to the outside of your home by arranging a Christmas planter box in front of your window. There are a generous amount of plants and flowers that blossom in the winter you can arrange for a Christmas scene.\nStart with ferns and evergreens as your base before adding holiday staples like poinsettias for color or pinecones. Go the extra Christmas mile by adding a red bow to the center of your holiday box.\nContinue to 8 of 46 below\n08\nof 46\nSimple Laurel Leaf Wreaths\nHappy Happy Nester\nKeep your Christmas window decorations simple with laurel leaf wreaths. This plant produces gorgeous green leaves that fit perfectly with other farmhouse Christmas decor. You can drape them with ribbons as seen in the picture above.\nLaurel leaves are lighter than traditional Christmas greenery, making this option a nice idea for those looking for a modern approach to Christmas decor.\nContinue to 9 of 46 below\n09\nof 46\nBanner\nGolden Boys & Me\nOne of our favorite things about using your windows for Christmas decor is that it has similar functions as a mantel, which means it's the perfect place to hang a seasonal banner. Wish everyone who visits a Merry Christmas by hanging a banner in front of your window with this saying or other Christmas icons.\nSince a banner will hang from corner to corner, this idea also leaves room to use your window trim for a garland of choice or hang wreaths like Jennifer did here.\nTip\nIf you can't find a pre-made Christmas banner you like, make your own. Choose a banner with dangling ribbon flaps to write your own message. Take this step further by writing the same message on the back so it's visible from the outside.\nContinue to 10 of 46 below\n10\nof 46\nOrnament Garland\nDans Le Lakehouse\nThe mantel isn't the only place to lay your garland—your window is just as welcoming. Feel chic and full of holiday cheer while washing dishes after sprucing up the trim of your window by combining your favorite colored ornaments and lush garland to create a festive DIY design.\nThough green and red are traditional Christmas colors, add your own personality and style to the strand by selecting ornaments of your favorite shade that don't fit the seasonal color palette.\nContinue to 11 of 46 below\n11\nof 46\nWhite Snow Display\nMaryna Terletska / Getty Images\nLive somewhere where snow is scarce or just want to build all the cozy feels in your home? Create your own winter wonderland with a faux snow display along your windowsill.\nRoll out a line of felt snow or scatter pull-apart artificial snow along the bottom of your window before adding more holiday decorations like candles, string lights, poinsettias, gingerbread houses, and villages.\nBuild the cozy, snowy feel even more by using a fake snow aerosol to spray the edges of your window to create an icy look.\nContinue to 12 of 46 below\n12\nof 46\nWindow Village\nSunny Side Up\nChristmas village decor has been around since the 19th century and has turned into an adorable seasonal collection and tradition in some homes. If you have a vintage or modern Christmas village set, consider placing them in front of your window instead of the standard table.\nContinue to 13 of 46 below\n13\nof 46\nClassic Tall Candles\nSusanne / Instagram\nSimplify your Christmas window decorations with the help of some candles. Candles have long ties to the holiday but apart from their deeper meaning, their warm flames add ambiance and warmth to your home.\nThis set-up doesn't stop with the actual candle. Take your display further, like Susanne did here, by placing dried sliced oranges in the bottom of the jar and scattering plain or frosted pinecones along the windowsill.\nDrying oranges yourself and choosing pinecones from your yard for this design is a great way to stay green with natural Christmas decor that's eco-friendly.\nContinue to 14 of 46 below\n14\nof 46\nMagnolia Leaf Garland\nBria Hammel Interiors\nIf you want to take a minimalist approach to Christmas decorating, drape a magnolia leaf garland across the top of the window like this space from Bria Hammel Interiors.\nContinue to 15 of 46 below\n15\nof 46\nCheery Wooden Sign\nSouthern Surroundings / Instagram\nWhether you're looking to decorate your porch for Christmas or just the windows, you can never go wrong with a wooden sign.\nIf your front door has windows, swapping the traditional holiday wreath for a wooden sign still makes a warm welcome for your guests.

Bells are another holiday icon that makes the most darling garland idea to drape in front of your window.\nMake your own bell garland by stringing together mini bells before securing each end to a window corner. Having the bells drape down in front of the window leaves plenty of room to cover the window trim in greenery garland, a DIY ornament garland, or for taping your Christmas cards.\nContinue to 19 of 46 below\n19\nof 46\nCeramic Home Window Display\nLiudmila Chernetska / Getty Images\nIf you've run out of table or shelf space for your Christmas decor display, a window is the perfect place to arrange your Christmas ceramics.

These bigger versions of the famous Christmas tree decor are perfect to get crafty with and make a garland to hang on your window.\nThis oversized ornament garland made by Kelly demonstrates how seasonal decor doesn't have to align with tradition completely. She used multiple colors for a bright look and modern twist that still exemplifies Christmas decor.\nContinue to 23 of 46 below\n23\nof 46\nTiny Tree\nSusanne / Instagram\nStaying on trend with space-saving, consider placing one or multiple tiny trees along your windowsill this holiday. In this photo, Susanne scattered a handful of tiny trees in between lighted ceramics and string lights along her window before placing a larger tiny tree in the corner.\nIf you don't have room for a full-size Christmas tree, setting a smaller tree on your windowsill is a great compromise that saves space and keeps the holiday tradition alive.\nContinue to 24 of 46 below\n24\nof 46\nPaper Snowflakes\nSusanne / instagram\nIf you love getting crafty, make paper snowflakes to dangle down your winter for another DIY snowy scene.

Arrange string lights in the form of a tree along your window with the help of tape or Command hooks to keep it in place.\nThis design adds ambiance to your home and gives those who pass by a cute visual to appreciate.\nTip\nFor extra decor, hang mini ornaments off the ends of the strings to add color and make the design even more adorable.\nContinue to 26 of 46 below\n26\nof 46\nHanging Mistletoe\nNata Golubnycha / Getty Images\nUp the romance in your home and Christmas window decorations by hanging a mistletoe in front of the glass. These plants symbolize good luck (after getting a quick kiss underneath) and are smaller to decorate with than other seasonal florals or plants. If you hang real mistletoe, don't forget to properly maintain it.\nContinue to 27 of 46 below\n27\nof 46\nWhite Branches\nVirginia Sweet Pea\nBring a vision of the snowy outdoors to your window with a vase of white branches. If you're not a floral person, this idea still encompasses a natural element of the season that's simple to arrange to give your home a snowy feel—no plant maintenance required.\nContinue to 28 of 46 below\n28\nof 46\nMetallic Bells\nCottage on Bunker Hill\nMetallic bells are stunning to hang in front of your window with a set of string lights and green garland.

Using your wrapped gifts as Christmas window decor is a great way to add seasonal flair to this overlooked area of the home and maximize floor space. If you have a smaller home where the floor is limited arrange your gifts along the windowsill to keep the floor open.\nContinue to 33 of 46 below\n33\nof 46\nLanterns\nMaya23k / Getty Images\nUsing lanterns as your Christmas window decor is a great way to add ambiance to your home and focus on rustic elements other than traditional icons.

We're sharing 20 budget-friendly decor ideas that will ensure that your bedroom feels a bit more personalized and styled, whether you're in need of some additional decorative accents or are wondering what to do about a headboard.\n01\nof 20\nDIY a Headboard\nJessie Ruane\nWhile beautiful, fabric-covered headboards can be expensive. If you're handy, it's worthwhile to make your own to save money. Use a staple gun and the fabric of your choosing to craft a stylish headboard like the green velvet one seen here. If you already have a bit of fabric left over from a prior home project, this is an excellent way to make the most of it, too.\nContinue to 2 of 20 below\n02\nof 20\nInstall a Mural\n@tulipsforthetable / Instagram\nWallpaper often costs a pretty penny, so if you love the look but can't commit to covering all four walls of your bedroom, why not opt for the next best thing—a wall mural? This black and white nature-themed mural shines behind the bed in this apartment room and is removable, too, making it ideal for renters.\nContinue to 3 of 20 below\n03\nof 20\nDesign a Stellar Storage System\n@hattiekolp / Instagram\nIf you're short on closet space, why not build a wardrobe of your own? This one was made from existing IKEA pieces, but the addition of new hardware and luxurious-looking picture frame molding makes it appear custom. Cabinets like these are also useful for tucking away games, seasonal decor, beauty products, and much more.\nContinue to 4 of 20 below\n04\nof 20\nPaint an Arch\n@shoebox.designs / Instagram\nLooking to add some energy to your bedroom while using up extra paint? Incorporate an arch design like this one, which will add visual interest to your sleep space. Painting one directly behind your bed creates a faux headboard effect, as seen here.\nContinue to 5 of 20 below\n05\nof 20\nMake Your Own Art\n@annawpage / Instagram\nRather than shelling out hundreds of dollars for a high-end art piece, consider making your own! Purchase a blank canvas from the craft store and have fun experimenting with your own abstract designs; you truly can't go wrong.\nContinue to 6 of 20 below\n06\nof 20\nSwitch Out a Light Fixture\n@mariannesides / Instagram\nIf builder-grade light fixtures are making your bedroom look bland, switch them out for something that fits your style. To save some cash in the process, take to secondhand stores and websites to source your new piece; the one shown above was a Facebook Marketplace find.\nContinue to 7 of 20 below\n07\nof 20\nShop Your Fabric Drawer\n@_harlowejames / Instagram\nTo give your headboard a new look without having to part with it, drape some fabric overtop. You'll feel like you've introduced a different piece into the room.\nContinue to 8 of 20 below\n08\nof 20\nStencil Your Wall\n@clare.sull / Instagram\nGive your walls a makeover with the help of some paint and stencils. This creates the effect of wallpaper yet can easily be painted over should your style change.\nContinue to 9 of 20 below\n09\nof 20\nTurn a Stool Into a Nightstand\n@citychicdecor / Instagram\nIf you don't wish to invest in a nightstand, note that a stool works just as wonderfully and it doesn't have to be large to be effective. This small wooden one adds a welcome pop of color to this all-white bedroom.\nContinue to 10 of 20 below\n10\nof 20\nBrighten the Bedroom With Sconces\n@gusandjeans / Instagram\nSconces make a bedroom look extra elevated, but they don't need to be drilled into the wall to look great. So that you don't have to hire an electrician, opt for plug-in sconces with wires that can easily be tucked behind the bed frame.\nContinue to 11 of 20 below\n11\nof 20\nGo Green With Plants\n@brittvandehaar / Instagram\nDecorative objects can be expensive, but small plants are generally affordable and will work wonders in adding personality to your sleep space. Place them in cute pots that complement your aesthetic.\nContinue to 12 of 20 below\n12\nof 20\nPick Up Dried Flowers\n@studio.trevow / Instagram\nKeeping fresh flowers on hand is always nice, but dried flowers and grasses are a cost saver in that you only have to purchase a bouquet once. Here, a vase of tall grass adds a textural element next to the bed.\nContinue to 13 of 20 below\n13\nof 20\nUpgrade Your IKEA\n@elm_terrace_interior / Instagram\nThere are so many ways to get creative with existing IKEA wardrobes; this is just another example of what a little paint and paneling can do to transform one of these pieces.\nContinue to 14 of 20 below\n14\nof 20\nPaint a Two Toned Wall\n@misc.brooke / Instagram\nAnother way to make use of leftover paint you already have on hand is to paint a two-toned wall in the bedroom. This look is very modern and means that you don't have to fully commit to going big with one color.\nContinue to 15 of 20 below\n15\nof 20\nInstall Beadboard Behind the Bed\n@happilyinspired / Instagram\nTo add architectural character to your home, you can DIY your own beadboard wall like this one, which looks very sophisticated. As a bonus, the top ledge of this wall is the perfect spot to display some leaning art. To save money, print out digital downloads that speak to you and arrange them in a set of matching frames.\nContinue to 16 of 20 below\n16\nof 20\nShop Your Home for Accessories\n@goshasblog / Instagram\nBasic household items can double as chic bedroom accessories. Shop your house for things like hats and small baskets that you can hang on the walls to add personality to your bedroom.\nContinue to 17 of 20 below\n17\nof 20\nDIY a Vanity\n@coorie_renovations / Instagram\nIf you've always longed for a vanity but aren't looking to spend much or utilize a ton of space in your bedroom, try replicating a setup like this one. A small wooden shelf serves as an excellent getting-ready spot; just hang a mirror and pull up a stool and apply your makeup at this makeshift station.\nContinue to 18 of 20 below\n18\nof 20\nMake It Mismatched\n@sarahlyon9 / Instagram\nDon't worry about sourcing matching nightstands for your bedroom; many people opt for a mismatched look, which can add an eclectic feel to any space. Plus, using two different styles means that you don't have to choose between two favorite pieces of furniture.\nContinue to 19 of 20 below\n19\nof 20\nGo Thrifting\n@dominiquegebru / Instagram\nTake to the thrift store in search of bedroom furniture; you never know what you might find! These mid-century modern nightstands are durable and classic and aren't something you can easily order from today's retailers.\nContinue to 20 of 20 below\n20\nof 20\nSpray Paint Furniture\n@sarahlyon9 / Instagram\nUse spray paint to bring a preloved chair back to life. Wicker is a great material to work with, as it's easy to spray and can be sourced affordably at thrift stores.\nTan France Loves a Good Sale: The 3 Budget Home Decor Tips He Swears By"

A basic IKEA shoe cabinet got a chic makeover with a little bit of caning that is also super practical.\n06\nof 20\nKeep Things Laid Back\nKate Lester Interiors\nFor a more laid-back look, try tucking away some oversized woven baskets in your entryway and tossing pairs of shoes inside.

Kitchen drawer pulls and door knobs are high-touch surfaces that should be made from quality materials that are easy to clean and will stand up to wear and tear.\nFrom warm- or cool-toned to black metal, wood, glass, or even leather, changing your kitchen cabinet hardware is an easy way to upgrade your kitchen without spending a fortune on a gut renovation. You can choose hardware to complement the style of your kitchen cabinets or to add contrast to white, black, or colorful cabinetry. Your kitchen cabinet hardware can be understated or bring a needed dose of bling to a minimalist kitchen.\nHere are some kitchen cabinet hardware ideas in a range of styles and combinations to help you narrow down your choices, whether you're building a new kitchen from scratch or giving a small rental apartment an affordable makeover.\n01\nof 36\nBlack Metal on White Wood\nLouis Duncan-He Designs / Photo by Eymeric Wildling\nLouis Duncan-He Designs added black metal cabinetry pulls on the white painted Shaker-style wood cabinetry of this spacious modern farmhouse inspired kitchen, giving the space a cohesive feel that ties in with the black-and-white palette and mix of silver and wood accents.\nContinue to 2 of 36 below\n02\nof 36\nBrass on Pale Gray\nTyler Karu Design and Interiors / Photo by Erin Little\nTyler Karu Design and Interiors added warmth to the pale gray blue hues of this coastal Maine kitchen with shiny brass cabinet pulls that echo the sink plumbing hardware and trio of pendant lights over the black farmhouse sink.\nContinue to 3 of 36 below\n03\nof 36\nScandi-Style Wood\nDesign by Cathie Hong Interiors / Margaret Austin Photo\nThe mint green cabinets in this Japandi-style home from Cathie Hong Interiors are accented with pale wood door tabs with rounded edges that feel soft, warm, and smooth to the touch and complement the Scandi-style wood niche and Japanese kitkat tile backsplash to create a tranquil zen feel.\nContinue to 4 of 36 below\n04\nof 36\nSilver Tab Pulls\nFantastic Frank\nWhile cabinet hardware can add some pizzazz to plain cabinetry, if you're going for a minimalist look, choose functional pulls that are there when you need them but don't call attention to themselves when you don't. This all-white kitchen from Fantastic Frank has glossy lacquered flat-front European-style cabinetry with discreet silver tab pulls on the doors that fade into the background to maintain a streamlined minimalist look.\nContinue to 5 of 36 below\n05\nof 36\nRose Gold Bars\nDesign by DasMod and Handsome Salt / Photo by Jenny Siegwart\nWarm rose-gold hardware complements the golden wood and cool mint green painted cabinetry in this spacious modern minimalist kitchen designed by Eric Gilmer and Sven Simon of DasMod in conjunction with interior designer Sara Simon of Handsome Salt.\nContinue to 6 of 36 below\n06\nof 36\nBlack on Black\nDesign by Space Factory / Photo by HervÃ© Goluza\nThis Parisian kitchen from Space Factory mixes high and low elements to create a custom look.

Becca Interiors used aged brass half moon cabinet pulls on the lower cabinets of this spacious beige-toned kitchen that enhances the traditional look of the updated space. Adding a few hanging copper pots, homey ceramics, and a gilded framed painting leaning casually against the backsplash reinforces the old world feel.\nContinue to 9 of 36 below\n09\nof 36\nLeather Pulls\nHome Consultant\nHome Consultant skipped the hardware and added supple leather pulls to the wood cabinetry in this Southern California kitchen that gives it a softer and more organic feel and adds contrast with the Carrara marble countertops. Keep in mind that leather pulls will develop a patina over time from contact with the natural oils in fingers, which some people will find as delightful as a well worn leather wallet or pair of boots. But if you like to keep your kitchen pristine, consider another material that can be wiped clean.\nContinue to 10 of 36 below\n10\nof 36\nMidcentury-Style Recycled Brass\nFinding Lovely / Ruth Eileen Photography\nFinding Lovely chose midcentury modern style knobs and pulls made from 95% recycled brass that work just as well on the white painted cabinetry as the vivid cobalt island cabinet doors in this bright and fresh farmhouse style kitchen.\nContinue to 11 of 36 below\n11\nof 36\nSwan Neck Cabinet Pulls\nStudio Peake\nIn this traditional London kitchen from Studio Peake, brass vintage-style dropped swan neck cabinet pulls add a classic finishing touch paired with saturated teal paint on the built-in cabinetry and small kitchen island.\nContinue to 12 of 36 below\n12\nof 36\nSilver Tones\nCasa Watkins Living\nIn this colorful kitchen from Casa Watkins Living, using the same simple silver pulls and knobs on a mix of stained and painted wood cabinetry helps to pull the two finishes together and ties in with the silver-toned appliances.

Charlie Coull Design used a crisp palette of black and white that includes floor-to-ceiling built-in cabinetry and sculptural pendant lighting over the island. A monumental black metal grid glass door adds a polished industrial edge and lets the natural light in. Brown herringbone patterned flooring adds interest, and chunky wood floating shelves give the wall of cabinetry some breathing room.

In this London home from Studio Peake, an antique chest of drawers in an empty space on the landing makes a perfect spot to offload off-season sweaters, scarves, and more.\n15\nof 33\nHack Some Built-Ins\nA Beautiful Mess\nIf you have the space for a closet but lack one, hack an IKEA wardrobe system to create a custom look and solve a host of clothing storage needs without breaking the budget, like these faux built-ins from A Beautiful Mess.\n16\nof 33\nUse a Leaning Ladder\nDesign by Sara Tramp for Emily Henderson Design / Photo by Tessa Neustadt\nLook for stylish ways to store accessories in your bedroom to take the pressure off your main closet.

A Beautiful Mess added simple wall hooks in neat rows to the wall outside the closet to keep everything organized, visible, and right at hand.\n18\nof 33\nUse an Antique Armoire\nEmily Henderson Design / Photo by Sara Ligorria-Tramp\nSource vintage, antique, or second-hand armoires at thrift stores or estate sales that were built for the days before built-in closets. Emily Henderson Design placed a curvy antique armoire in a niche in this spacious bedroom, but you could just as easily repaint a budget piece from your favorite thrift store if that better suits your style or budget.\n19\nof 33\nHang Some Pipe\nLiz Marie Blog\nUse affordable industrial materials to build a boutique-style open closet. Blogger Liz Marie created clean, industrial-looking clothing storage space by mounting two staggered lengths of galvanized pipe on a blank wall. A row of hooks for a hat collection were made using large carriage bolts.\n20\nof 33\nUse a Freestanding Rack\nFantastic Frank\nUse a freestanding clothes rack if you have a minimalist wardrobe and want to keep everything on display to make it easier to get dressed in the morning. In this airy Swedish studio apartment from Fantastic Frank, a simple white freestanding clothing rack is perched outside the glass-and-metal doors separating the sleeping area from the main space.\nContinue to 21 of 33 below\n21\nof 33\nChoose a Nightstand Dresser\nBecca Interiors\nTrade a nightstand for a full-size dresser where you can store pajamas, slippers, and loungewear, freeing up space in a smaller closet, like this space from Becca Interiors.\n22\nof 33\nRepurpose a China Cabinet\nStudio Peake\nGive an old china cabinet a makeover and turn it into clothes storage for your bedroom. Studio Peake repainted a glass-front china cabinet red, then added pleated white fabric on the interior that is decorative while hiding the contents.\n23\nof 33\nImprovise a Hall Closet\nFantastic Frank\nIf your entryway lacks storage, improvise a coat closet with an old wooden ladder and a pair of black metal wall shelves, like this space from Fantastic Frank.\n24\nof 33\nExtend Your Closet\nmily Bowser for Emily Henderson Design / Photo by Sara Ligorria-Tramp\nUse the space outside of your closet for spillover items.

While we agree that it’s often easier to close the door on clutter—whether that be crammed clothes or an overflowing assortment of accessories (shoes, hats, tote bags)—having to dig through an entire closet to get to one item that’s been pushed to a back shelf gets old. Fast. That’s where the best closet kits come in. \nAdjustable shelves, a plethora of drawers, and strategically placed rods in a closet kit can make quick work of a blank space. All of our favorites are listed below and can suit a variety of designs and storage needs. While they're not going to give you the same devoted expertise and custom feel as a closet design company would, they will be far less pricey and much faster to acquire. If you’re ready to remedy that pile of clothes on the floor once and for all, and to make the most of a walk-in or reach-in closet, or even a plain wall, scroll on. \nFirst Things First\nBefore drilling any holes, experts stress it’s essential to take stock of your current belongings and diligently discard what you don’t use or need (aka the clutter-causing culprits) first. This way, you can ensure you’re setting up your space for the right amount of items, and not buying a second shelf only for it to end up holding those holiday sweaters that you actually meant to donate last year.\nOur Top Picks\nBest Overall Closet Kit:\nThe Container Store Elfa System at The Container Store $1,560\nJump to Review\nBest Value:\nRubbermaid Configurations Closet Kits at Amazon $110\nJump to Review\nBest Basic:\nSALE Amazon Basics Expandable Wardrobe at Amazon $105 $78\nJump to Review\nBest Splurge:\nCalifornia Closets The Everyday System by Martha Stewart at Wayfair $1,056\nJump to Review\nBest Freestanding:\nBlu Dot Garden Party Wardrobe System at Wayfair $1,156\nJump to Review\nBest Modular Combination:\nIKEA Boaxel Wardrobe Combination at Ikea $158\nJump to Review\nBest Shelf:\nCloset Evolution Essential Shelf White Wood Closet Tower at Home Depot $154\nJump to Review\nBest Corner System:\nDotted Line Grid Closet System Corner System at Wayfair $1,360\nJump to Review\nBest Overall Closet Kit\nThe Container Store Elfa System\nPHOTO: The Container Store\n$1,560 at The Container Store\nWhat We Like\nResults tailored to your exact needs\nAccessible design tools\nExpansive offerings\nWhat We Don't Like\nOnly available at one retailer\nSlower process than ordering a pre-made kit\nIt’s impossible to write about closet kits without shouting out The Container Store’s Elfa Closet System. The expansive collection offers custom and DIY options that suit a range of budgets, styles, and preferences, including slim rods and racks in walnut or a wall of light and airy vented shelves. Whether your needs are ultra-specific or you're looking to fill a standard closet with a practical set that can be adapted over time, you'll be able to find something from Elfa. Even a super-small entryway closet can be handled (check out this three-foot starter kit, for example). The Container Store has thought of everything.  \nThe smart custom components show thorough attention to detail—from features like decorative fascia (edges that clip to the front of your shelves for a more upscale look) to coordinating additions like drawer units, wall racks, rolling carts, and bins. There are also two lines to choose from—Elfa Classic (the original design) and Elfa Decor (elevated with wood material and finishes), both of which are available in select, pre-fab combos based on your desired dimensions (choices range from 2 to 3 feet, 4 to 5 feet, 6 to 7 feet, and 8 to 11 feet). \nIf you live near a Container Store location, you can also pop in to check out options in person, but even if you're not near an IRL location, you can still work with the brand online. Consultations are free but do note that a tailored approach will run you upwards of $1,000. In our experience, a two-person primary closet system is priced in the $1,400 range, and for a moderately-sized walk-in, it's closer to $1,600.\nWhether you’re curious about custom closets, or certain you want a predesigned kit, Elfa is worth a (very!) close look.\nDimensions: Varies | Material: Varies, including epoxy-bonded steel, wood, laminate | Mount Type: Wall-mounted or standalone | Number of Shelves: Varies | Number of Rods: Varies | Number of Drawers: Varies\nPHOTO: The Spruce / Deanna McCormack\nBest Value\nRubbermaid Configurations Closet Kits\nPHOTO: Amazon\n$110\n$96 at Amazon\n$162 at Walmart\n$110 at Wayfair\nWhat We Like\nExtremely versatile configuration options\nMaterials are durable and adjustable\nInstallation is straightforward\nWhat We Don't Like\nCan require extra hardware\nWire shelving can be flimsy\nWe’ve loved the Rubbermaid Classic Custom Metal Closet Configuration Storage Kit for years now, and it’s edged into the best bang for your buck due to its versatility, adjustability, and reliability, all for an excellent price. It comes in pre-sorted sets of metal materials (choose between a titanium or powder-coated white finish) and accommodates closets ranging from 2 to 4 feet, all the way up to 6 to 10 feet, so you can organize compact linen closets or vast walk-ins.\nIn our experience of testing this closet kit, the stainless steel material is sturdy. Each vertical rod has rows of parallel holes that make it easy to set and adjust shelves. It’s worth noting that many systems and kits give you options for wall placement and shelf positioning, but this Rubbermaid kit stands out for how streamlined it is. You can add, adjust, and remove shelves and horizontal rods as often as you like. Replacement pieces and shelves are sold individually, but if you find yourself in need of additional parts down the road, you won’t have to purchase an entirely new set.\nThe installation process is straightforward, though we needed extra hardware. We opted to pick up our own anchors, screws, and washers to make the unit feel more secure (a trick that we’d recommend for most other options on this list, too).\nNo closet kit is perfect, and in this case, the shelves do have weight limits, as we saw the wire material bow under the weight of a kids’ wooden block collection. The plethora of configuration options may also leave those who prefer thorough instructions for every step of the installation process wanting more guidance for shelf placement. Despite these minor issues, we still believe it’s an excellent choice for an all-around kit that will elevate a variety of closets throughout your home, without having to drop more than $200.\nDimensions: Varies; specs are for 3-6 foot kit | Material: Metal | Mount Type: Wall-mounted | Number of Shelves: 8 | Number of Rods: 2 | Number of Drawers: 0\nPHOTO: The Spruce / Stacey Nash\nBest Basic\nAmazon Basics Expandable Wardrobe\nPHOTO: Amazon\n$105\n$78 at Amazon\nWhat We Like\nSurprisingly sturdy, constructed with steel\nExtra-wide leveling feet (up to 4 inches)\nWhat We Don't Like\nLimited spaces it can comfortably fit in, between 57 and 80 inches\nNot as many adjustable features compared to other kits we’ve tried\nIf you’d prefer to avoid drilling altogether, then this bare-bones offering easily inserts into a closet without ever needing to be wall-mounted (though you may want to consider it for safety measures if you plan to load it up). All assembly requires is screwing the individual pieces together. Even better, it costs less than $100. \nA total of 10 tiered shelves on the right and left sides flank two sets of rods in the center of the piece. The shelves are a bit on the small side, roomy enough just for a single pair of shoes. Still, we appreciate that the wired construction can be combated with complimentary plastic slip sleeves to provide a flat, even surface. We think the best way to take advantage of the extra space is stacking folded sweaters or jeans, which also keep everything clearly within eyesight (saving bags and bulkier items for the tippy-top shelves). \nAs far as appearances go, this unit is only available in a black or bronze coating, but for a simple reach-in closet situation we don’t mind the bare style. The whole thing is relatively lightweight, too, at just 36 pounds, making it plenty possible for a single person to set up on their own. \nDimensions: 14x57-80x72 inches | Material: Alloy steel and plastic | Mount Type: Floor mount | Number of Shelves: 10 | Number of Rods: 2 | Number of Drawers: 0\nBest Splurge\nCalifornia Closets The Everyday System by Martha Stewart\nPHOTO: Wayfair\n$1,056 at Wayfair\nView on Californiaclosets.com\nWhat We Like\nDesigned with hidden track\n40 predesigned combinations\nElegant finish choices\nWhat We Don't Like\nA major investment\nHave your sights set on a high-end kit? We’d like to direct you to California Closets. There may be no other company in the game with as much brand recognition when it comes to custom closets. This adaptable and movable collaboration with Martha Stewart is everything you’d expect of the DIY stalwart herself. \nThe key to its adjustability lies in the hidden track system. Unlike most other closet kits, shelf holes are visible and on constant display—that isn’t the case with the Everyday System. Other features worth the higher price tag include soft-close drawers that fully extend and interchangeable mesh bins for extra breathability. \nAs for installation, it mounts onto the wall at four different points, and the bottom pieces include built-in levelers if you have sloped floors (owners of older homes and apartments know this all too well). \nThere are 40 (not a typo!) pre-designed configurations (a handful even extend beyond the closet to include home office, media, and pantry storage) that range in size from 4-5-foot systems to 13-foot spaces and larger, even L-shape styles. It’s worth browsing the entire assortment, as some styles favor shoes, others prioritize hanging racks, and a couple includes a middle, enclosed cabinet. Needless to say, the possibilities are pretty vast. \nThe finish choices also feel decidedly luxurious, offering a variety of woodgrains with white, brass, and graphite powder-coated metal details. For our purposes, the standard offering provides 64 inches of hanging space with four rods, nine shelves (including a top shelf), and three drawers to play with. \nDimensions: Varies | Material: Engineered wood and metal | Mount Type: Wall mount | Number of Shelves: 10 | Number of Rods: 4 | Number of Drawers: 3\nBest Freestanding\nBlu Dot Garden Party Wardrobe System\nPHOTO: Blu Dot\n$1,156 at Wayfair\nView on Bludot.com\nWhat We Like\nSleek, modern aesthetic\nDurable, steel tube frame and shelves\nAdditional shelving or garment racks from the same line offer seamless expansion capabilities\nWhat We Don’t Like\nNo adjustability\nShelf weight capacity up to 20 pounds\nIf your closet space is limited (or completely nonexistent) and you don’t want to tap just any old hanging rack for the task—it’s bound to be on display 24/7, after all—simple elegance is best, and for that, you can’t go wrong with Blu Dot. The Garden Party line, in particular, is sure to appeal to minimalists. This standalone wardrobe will especially help when paring back your belongings is the goal. We wouldn’t want to put anything but the best on its rod and shelves. \nIn fact, we see it being more of a solution to general closet overflow than wrangling one or two people’s collection of clothing. It’s more like a pedestal for the pieces most frequently in your rotation (or that you want to photograph). We also adore the subtle addition of two solid white oak knobs on each end, allowing for impromptu hanging moments, so you can more easily grab your favorite of-the-moment handbag or jacket. (To further help limit visual clutter, consider adding the matching storage box in the same warm, white oak.)\nWhile the price tag is certainly hefty for a lack of customization, we think the durable steel construction, curvy details, and general aesthetic more than makes up for it. Originally from the Midwest, the brand boasts an in-house team of designers, and you can pretty much count on this being carefully packaged. \nDimensions: 68x64x16 inches | Material: Steel and solid wood | Mount Type: Floor mount | Number of Shelves: 7 | Number of Rods: 1 | Number of Drawers: 0\nBest Modular Combination\nIKEA Boaxel Wardrobe Combination\nPHOTO: IKEA\n$158 at Ikea\nWhat We Like\nEasy to customize—expandable and adaptable over time\nAvailable in white, dark gray, and oak\nMountable inside and outside of a closet\nWhat We Don’t Like\nExtensive setup (IKEA warns two pairs of hands are better than one!)\nYou don’t have to sacrifice form over function—or your wallet, for that matter—when shopping IKEA’s closet kits. The classic Boaxel combination is an editor-favorite, and has been praised for its modularity. It’s moved from apartment to apartment, and we appreciate its ability to look just as good outside of a closet as it does behind closed doors (if you kept yours open for this reason, we wouldn’t blame you). \nIt earns the modular spot for the fact that it’s a breeze to add onto a single, slim unit, especially since the classic designs have proven staying power. With Boaxel in particular, you can place shelves, baskets, and rods pretty much anywhere thanks to the bracket system.\nJust pop them in and out of the metal frame. If we had to pick just one combination to start with, it’d be the standard option linked above, plus a rod for ankle-length skirts, dresses, and jackets. The bottom rack is the perfect place for footwear, too. (But if you aren’t sure what you’re looking for or need, the Swedish retailer also has a handy digital planner where you can essentially ‘build-your-own’ closet kit).\nIf the Boaxel doesn’t suit your fancy, don’t fret. There are tons of sleek, modern shelving styles to choose from at IKEA. We also love the Pax for a bookcase-like fit and the Aurdal combination for its slightly elevated style (and those wire baskets!). \nDimensions: 49x15x79 inches | Material: Steel, plastic, particle board | Mount Type: Wall mount | Number of Shelves: 5 | Number of Rods: 1 | Number of Drawers: 2\nBest Shelf\nCloset Evolution Essential Shelf White Wood Closet Tower\nPHOTO: The Home Depot\n$154 at Home Depot\nWhat We Like\nSimple and versatile in design\nFour available finishes\nCan be used on its own or within set\nWhat We Don’t Like\nLengthy assembly process\nShips in two individual boxes for a single tower\nForget rods and drawers, if all you need is shelves, shelves, and more shelves, we recommend scooping up a few of these individual towers by Closet Evolution. The tidy piece comes in four neutral colors and has seven shelves spaced in its 72-inch design, giving you lots of storage space. Three of the shelves are fixed, while four are adjustable, so you can space them further apart for stacks of sweaters, or close together for short bins of socks or ties. It can work in an entryway for bags and hats, a linen closet for towels and sheets, as well as a bedroom closet, so plan accordingly if you have lots of closets in need of sprucing up.\nWe appreciate that these are durable, 5.8-inch laminate pieces in a scratch-resistant surface that should hold up for a long time. These are designed to be mounted right on the wall, so you don’t have to worry about removing or messing with your baseboards. \nHardware is included for installation, which is straightforward. We can see this piece working well on its own, or with other pieces from the Closet Evolution line (note that each item is sold separately, so creating a full kit would quickly add up). But for the structure and versatility of wall-mounted shelving, without the extra steps of a fully installed closet system, it’s ideal. \nPsst: Have an awkward, unused corner? The brand also makes a $315 30-inch six-shelf unit, too. \nDimensions: 72 x 25.13 x 14 inches | Material: Laminate | Mount Type: Wall-mounted | Number of Shelves: 7 | Number of Rods: 0 | Number of Drawers: 0\nBest Corner System\nDotted Line Grid Closet System Corner System\nPHOTO: Wayfair\n$1,360 at Wayfair\nWhat We Like\nIdeal for larger, walk-in closets\nCan be cut to fit a variety of spaces\nUltra-spacious, adjustable storage features (six rods and 14 shelves, to be precise)\nWhat We Don't Like\nCan’t rearrange where drawers and rods go\nCreating a dreamy walk-in closet doesn’t have to cost a fortune. Dotted Line’s Grid closet system can be cut to fit any room and offers a multitude of L-shaped corner styles to make the most of an open space. This particular pre-fab pick provides six clothing rails, including a higher set rod perfect for keeping long dresses and jackets free of wrinkles. It also offers a whopping 14 shelves, plus three drawers to house socks and underwear out of sight. There are even three bottom rows for shoes—a rare yet much-appreciated closet kit feature—that are equally adjustable, so you can wrangle flat sandals and tall boots.\nThis set is particularly designed for 7 and 10-foot-tall walls, but there are plenty of other sizes available (including a sprawling 113-inch upgrade and U-shaped three-kit combo), so we definitely see this brand working best if you have a lot of square footage to optimize. Constructed with engineered wood, it’s available in four finishes to suit a range of tastes, including white, honey blonde, weathered gray, and truffle (a dark brown). \nAs you can imagine, with all of these separate and quasi-customizable features, the installation process can be a bit intense. Still, it’s a labor worth the love. \nDimensions: 72 x 120 x 84 inches | Material: Engineered wood | Mount Type: Wall-mounted | Number of Shelves: 14 | Number of Rods: 6 | Number of Drawers: 3\nThe Spruce / Alex Dos Diaz\nA Couple Other Closet Kits Under $200\nIf you don’t necessarily need a bunch of adjustable, added features, we rounded up a few simple styles that get the job done, all without breaking the bank. \nClosetmaid Wire Closet Organizer Kit with Shoe Shelf: If wrapping your head around customizable and adjustable options is more annoying than helpful, consider this straightforward fixed-mount organizer kit from Closetmaid. It’s just under $100 and delivers a streamlined design that prioritizes shelf and hanging space—plus an added shoe rack that will keep your favorite footwear off the floor. There’s also lots of open and flexible space that’s perfect for bin and basket storage. \nClosetmaid Closet Maximizer: The aesthetically pleasing, cost-effective Closet Maximizer from Closetmaid gives you more than 8 feet of shelving, and up to 24.5 extra inches of rod space, while still smartly utilizing your existing rod or upper wire shelving. It’s not always easy to find a closet kit this cheap sans wired shelving, so you don’t have to worry about garments catching or snagging. Its four shelves are positioned 12.5 inches apart, so they comfortably hold containers for storing clothes, or loose items. It’s also extremely versatile—you can clip it onto your upper closet shelf or existing rod, and easily remove it for use in another closet. \nHow to Shop for a Closet Kit\nMeasure, Measure, Measure \nWhile many of the systems named here boast adjustable features, we’ve yet to find a true one-size-fits-all option. Even if you’re familiar with standard closet sizes, you’ll need to know the depth of your closet and the width and height of the wall you’ll be mounting your kit on. Be sure to follow manufacturer guidelines for leaving space above and below pieces, too.\nTo measure your walk-in closet for a closet kit, you’ll need a tape measure and potentially a step stool. These are the numbers you'll need to take down:\nFloor-to-ceiling measurements of the walls.\nThe width of your walls in three places: high, middle, and low heights where you want to place your closet kit. Jennifer Truesdale, CPO, and founder of STR8N UP Professional Organizing Services recommends maximizing the space between your knees and your eyebrows. Record each measurement, but know you’ll be using the smallest of the three for storage. \nThe width of your closet. Don’t forget to measure the wing walls, which are the walls on either side of the door!\nThe side of the wall to the door frame.\nThe height and width of your door, along with its swing direction.\nIf you have windows or any other items built into the wall, take their measurements and note them as well. \nInstallation Requirements\nOnce you’ve determined the correct size and type of kit for your closet, take into account how you’ll set it up. Most of the kits in this list are suitable for home installation if you (or a helpful partner or friend) have working knowledge of the tools required for assembly. Are you comfortable hammering, drilling, and leveling? If that’s not the case, or you’re unsure about the labor involved, call a professional.\nIf you do decide to DIY your closet installation, note that most options take a few hours to complete, and need one or two people. It's also worth mentioning that some brands offer installation as part of their package, The Container Store, which was our best overall pick.\nSmart Organization Options \nAs tempting as it may be to transform your closet into the most aesthetically pleasing version your budget allows, you may regret it if it’s not designed to match your lifestyle. As Truesdale puts it, “Don’t just buy one that looks nice, buy one that’s going to suit your needs.”\nFigure out your categories and ask yourself specific questions, like whether you need a way to organize hats, long garments, or workout gear. Once you do this, you’ll have a clear sense of whether you need to use shelving, drawers, hanging rods, bins, baskets, or a combination of two or more.\nIf footwear is your love language, consider a closet system that prioritizes shoe storage, or tap our favorite shelf unit, the Close Evolution Tower, purely to display your collection. so you don't have to devote floor space or keep them in boxes. “Display shoes on open shelving, shoe racks, or cubbies so you can see what you've got,\" says Shira Gill, home organizing expert and author of Minimalista.\nBaskets and bins are starting to appear as an included feature in some closet kits too, and we’re glad to see it. We love that they give you more security around the edge than shelves, and, depending on the design, can give you a peek at what's inside. Our best combination closet kit pick, the IKEA Boaxel system, offers sleek mesh drawers that serve these exact purposes.\nCustomization vs. Adjustability \nSome closet systems can only be configured in one way, while others can be assembled in several different arrangements. If you’re not sure what type of configuration will work best in your home—or want your product to be suitable in different spaces in the future—consider choosing a closet kit that offers more versatility. This will let you try out various designs and find the best option for your needs now and in the future.\nAdditionally, some closet organization brands sell add-on components for their systems, allowing you to add more drawers, baskets, and shelves down the line. This is handy if you are installing the kit in a kid's closet, and have needs that will likely change and expand from one year to the next.\nBe Mindful of Materials \nThe most common materials we see in closet kits are metal and wood, and it’s not unusual to find them working together in the same closet. Among the benefits to each, you’ll find that wood can be sturdier and looks more decorative and luxurious. Metal is usually the base for modular and adjustable systems, and has also proven to be durable and reliable, too.\nAs for potential downsides, wood systems can often be more expensive and bulky, so if not carefully designed, you may end up with less storage space than desired. Metal systems typically don’t feel as high-end, and slatted shelving is common, which by design includes gaps.\nStaying Within Budget  \nAt the time of publish, the pre-designed kits we feature range in price from $82 to upwards of $2,000. Keep in mind that these prices are typically for the materials (the bigger the kit, the more materials needed), so you’ll want to weigh in your time and labor (or factor costs of a professional), as well as shipping costs and extra tools or hardware you may not have on hand, like supports or fasteners. Accessories like bins and clothes hangers are also separate costs. \nOverall, we’ve found that closet kits can be an affordable and efficient way to elevate your closet storage, and are typically far more budget-friendly than custom closets, which can average $1,500 to $5,000+, according to Home Depot. \nThe Checkout Counter\nHere are a few select items that might also be helpful if you're looking to update your closet and better organize the space.\n6-pack of transparent storage bins: Perfect for shoes, scarves, accessories and more, these lidded bins are durable and stackable—the ideal combo for a closet refresh project.\n3-pack of nested baskets: If you want a more aesthetic vibe for your storage, woven baskets are a great option. Just make sure you're not storing anything delicate in them that could snag on the weave.\nStackable shoe rack: We loved this shoe rack when we tested it. Its compact, stackable design is great for a closet, tight hallway, or college dorm.\nOne More Thing \nWe do have a few inspirational and helpful pieces to help you get started, including one on how to organize your closet in six easy steps, along with clever shoe storage ideas and how to keep a linen closet in check. Or if you fancy yourself as being something of a DIY expert, we even have a step-by-step guide on how to make your own closet system. \nWhy Trust The Spruce?\nMorgan Bulman, our senior writer, has personal experience with California Closets and with the IKEA Boaxel unit (she has it installed on a bedroom wall to make up for a severe lack of closet space and a hard-to-break shopping habit). As someone who has lived in small apartments for most of her adult life, making the most of what space she has is paramount, and closet kits have certainly helped with that. For this piece, she did thorough research on closet kits currently available at major retailers, and evaluated products based on size, features, material, customization options, and overall value.\nOur Experts:\nDena Ogden, associate editor for The Spruce\nJennifer Truesdale, CPO, and founder of STR8N UP Professional Organizing Services\nShira Gill, home organizing expert and author of Minimalista"

  "articleText": "CLEANING & ORGANIZING ORGANIZING BEDROOM & CLOSET ORGANIZATION\n25 Dorm Room Organization Ideas That'll Elevate Your Space\nThese dorm storage and organization ideas will maximize space\nBy GRACE GALLAGHER\nUpdated on 09/11/24\nThe Spruce / Jason Donnelly\nDorm rooms are truly multi-tasking spaces: they're made for sleeping, studying, eating, and hanging out with friends. But what they aren't known for is being spacious or particularly orderly.\nThese dorm room storage ideas will help you think of creative ways to make the most of the space you do have. Whether it's under the bed or behind the door, vertical storage, or organized drawers, there are actually a surprising amount of ways to organize a dorm so you can fit clothes, books, cleaning supplies, and all other college living essentials.\n01\nof 25\nA Dorm Curtain Wall\n@bennyrebecca and @studio_benedetto\nIf you're looking to warm up the cold cinder block wall of a dorm room, try this cool trick. Installing a curtain over the wall instantly makes the room look more spacious, sophisticated, and a lot more inviting, plus it lets the dresser decor pop. Cinder block or brick walls aren't easy to drill into (nor would you want to if your dorm has rules about what you can put on the walls), but Command hooks or even heavy duty tape may be your friend here.\nA curved mirror makes that telltale dorm dresser a lot more chic, too.\n02\nof 25\nOrganized Drawers\nBreathing Room Home\nWhen drawers are organized, you can fit even more inside (and you'll always know where everything is). Here acrylic bins keep everyday essentials like cotton rounds and makeup remover wipes handy. A shower caddy for trekking shower supplies to and from the bathroom is also a dorm room must-have, so you can keep all your products in one place (and they won't get your furniture wet).\n03\nof 25\nTablet and Cord Organization\n@joanna_organize\nA desk organizer is a must for a small dorm room, especially one that has space for tablets and laptops. Cords don't have to look messy and tangled either when you are able to hide them behind an organizer. Storing tablets and laptops sideways frees up more space for books and studying. One of the handiest things about a system like this is that because everything has a very defined place, it's less likely that you won't be able to find a charger or tablet when it's time to study.\n04\nof 25\nUnder-Bed Storage\n@alysse.armstrong\nA lofted bed is a fantastic way to add square footage to a small dorm room. Some choose to loft the bed high enough where a couch or desk can fit under, and others may prefer to use the extra space for shelves or drawers. Most dorm beds are designed to be stacked (like bunk beds) or lofted, but it's usually a two-person job.\nContinue to 5 of 25 below\n05\nof 25\nUse the Dorm Windowsill\n@kelseymcary\nDorm room organization requires making the most of every space. Here a windowsill is wide enough for a reading lamp and a wicker basket (perfect for holding books). If you look closely, you'll notice a wire shelf on the desk which holds utensils and other essentials, so eating at the desk becomes more pleasant. On the desk itself, there's a coffee maker and a set of tiny drawers for organization.\n06\nof 25\nA Floating Bookshelf\n@_mytake\nClear some space on a desk by using a bookshelf. This one displays books vertically, so it doesn't take up a ton of space, plus it adds a cool colorful effect to the room. This type of styled shelf works as a piece of decor too, and it looks beautiful with the rainbow books. It also works well for storing textbooks and other bulkier items.\n07\nof 25\nA Dorm Room With Style\n@emptynestmomlife\nThere's a lot to love about this cozy dorm room, but one of the coolest things from a storage perspective is that the top of the coffee table top slides ofd. Inside it holds blankets and other spare linens, which are notoriously hard to find space for in a smaller space with an extra closet. Look for a small space coffee table to fit in a dorm and furniture that doubles as clever storage is always a smart idea.\n08\nof 25\nBookshelf Headboard\nFantastic Frank\nHang shelves to create a headboard bookshelf to store reading materials and display photos, plants, and art. Turn your bed into a daybed with some colorful throw pillows to create a cozy spot to study and read.\nContinue to 9 of 25 below\n09\nof 25\nA Stool With Storage\n@hippyhole\nHot tools can be bulky and hard to store, but this stool solves the problem. The top comes off and there's storage inside which is perfect for straightners, curling irons, and other hair tools that take up a lot of space. If you don't use hot tools, it's also a great place for chargers that aren't in use, cleaning supplies, or other things you don't need all the time. Plus, it doubles as extra seating when friends come over.\n10\nof 25\nA Dorm Room With a Nightstand for Storage\n@dorm_decor\nThis sophisticated navy and gold dorm room looks elevated and clean, thanks to plenty of storage (and of course, those upholstered headboards). When you lift the top off the ottoman, there's space inside for chargers, hot tools, and other odds and ends. The shared nightstand offers a bunch of space, and it's nice to be able to shut the door on any clutter.\n11\nof 25\nAn Organized Desk\nBlack & Blooms\nA dorm room desk can be both functional and beautiful. The cubbies, computer stand, and roomy woven baskets keep everything organized, while a houseplant, terrarium, and framed art looks warm and inviting. A set of lightweight drawers from Ikea works well as a desk stand, but if your dorm desk has drawers, you can always use something similar as a nightstand or in the closet.\n12\nof 25\nUse Wall Space\nBlack & Blooms\nIn a room with limited space, like a dorm, it's always a good idea to think vertical and use wall space. This hat storage idea uses the wall (you can use Command hooks if you're not allowed to make holes in the dorm), and it also works as part of the decor. Bags, jewelry, and baseball hats also work well for vertical storage.\nContinue to 13 of 25 below\n13\nof 25\nA Lofted Bed\n@bardadmission\nA mini fridge fits perfectly under a lofted bed, as this photo shows, and you can use the additional space for storage bins, out of season clothes, or extra books. Pushing your desk against the end of the bed, almost like a headboard, also works well for saving space and creating a little study nook.\n14\nof 25\nJewelry Storage\n@themodernmermaidtales\nKeep jewelry from getting tangled by hanging it from hooks. This way, you can see everything you have, and you don't have to waste precious dresser top space on a jewelry box. If you don't have much art, hanging jewelry also adds color and texture to the space. Tiny nail holes are easy enough to cover at the end of the year, or you could get creative a hanging this type of racking using sticky hooks or push pins.\n15\nof 25\nMakeup Drawer Organization\n@neatbymeg\nSure you could use your desk drawers for pens and office supplies, or you could use the precious real estate for makeup organization (and leave the pens etc. in a backpack). Here, small bins keep makeup brushes, products, and hair accessories organized so getting ready for a night out is stress free. If you have enough drawer space, it can be nice to lay out your makeup as well (as opposed to keeping it tucked away in a bag). This way, you can see what you have, and you'll know what you never use so you can get rid of it.\n16\nof 25\nCommand Hook Storage\n@neatbymeg\nAn organized closet is key for keeping a dorm room clutter-free. Here, hooks keep hats off the ground, and bag organizers (that also double as file holders when turned upside down) separate each bag, and woven baskets hold other accessories like scarves. You may not have a spacious closet in a dorm, but a few simple organizing hacks will make it feel a whole lot bigger, and it will streamline your routine so you have more time in the morning.\nContinue to 17 of 25 below\n17\nof 25\nDrawer Organizers\n@breathing.room.home\nUse drawer organizers to make the most of every drawer. Fabrics organizers or drawer dividers keep underwear and bras separate, which keeps the hard-to-fold items orderly. This type of customizable divider can be helpful for socks and workout clothes too.\n18\nof 25\nHooks and Baskets\nStudio DIY\nMake the most of the closet space you do have by installing a hanging rack for keeping backpacks, purses, totes, and other items organized. An over-the-door rack (which doesn't require any drilling) is dorm-friendly, as are baskets for storing out of season clothes or bulkier items that won't wrinkle if they're folded in a bin.\n19\nof 25\nDesk Drawer Organization\n@breathing.room.home\nMake your desk work for you by keeping it organized. When you're cramming for finals, you'll know exactly where to find your charging cord, highlighter, screen cleaner, (or Lifesaver mint for tough moments). Having some sort of desk organization is a good way to feel calm and ready when it's time to sit down to study, plus when you know where everything is you spend more time taking notes and less time looking for index cards or Post-Its.\n20\nof 25\nA Place for Everything\n@nycneat_louisa\nNot only is this colorfully organized desk aesthetically pleasing, but it keeps all those tiny desk supplies on display so they're easy to find. From staples and paper clips to highlighters and erasers, keep everything tidy (plus you'll be psyched to open your drawer).\nContinue to 21 of 25 below\n21\nof 25\nSpace-Saving Folding\n@nycneat_louisa\nUsing a space-saving folding technique takes no extra time on laundry day (once you get the easy technique down), plus it saves so much space in your drawers. There isn't one right way to fold clothes to save drawer space, and you may try a few different ways until you find one you like best.\n22\nof 25\nA Desk With Shelving\n@sylvitalacayo\nShelves on a desk are a great way to keep the desk surface for essentials while still having plenty of space for books, framed photos, and plants or other homey items that warm up a dorm. Many schools will have shelves above the desk, but if not, you can put a cubby shelf system on the desk itself which makes it so you don't have to drill anything.\n23\nof 25\nCommand Hooks for Wall Storage\n@lindseysoucie\nGot a lot of bags, and not a lot of space? No problem. Command hooks add wall storage in a spot that would otherwise go unused, and they won't cause any damage to the walls (so you're free of that annoying fine at the end of the year). The image shows an extensive backpack collection, but you can mix it up with different types of bags or hats, belts, and other accessories that hang easily.\n24\nof 25\nFloating Shelves in a Dorm\n@thenestingpot\nThis small dorm room has plenty of personality. An open shelf over the bed is perfect for displaying framed photos and other personal items while keeping the desk and dresser clear. This style shelf (with sides, like a bookshelf) works well for displaying items that would get damaged if they fell, but open storage also works well.\nContinue to 25 of 25 below\n25\nof 25\nDrawers Under Bed\n@bardadmission\nHere, thanks to a lofted bed and a clever desk placement, most of the furniture ends up along one wall of the dorm. If you have a single, you could use the other wall for a futon or extra seating for friends. And if both roommates opt for compact storage like this, it frees up space in the middle for a dance party.\nDorms rooms may be small, but they don't have to feel cramped. These dorm room storage and organization ideas make the most of the space, so it feels more inviting. Whether it's an organized desk drawer that makes studying more calm, a lofted bed with space underneath for a mini fridge or dresser, or simply using Command hooks to make the most of wall space, try these dorm organization ideas."

No matter what type of garden you have, you'll typically want to put taller plants in the back, then mid-size, then smaller plants so all plants get enough light exposure.\nHow do you make a low-maintenance garden?\nThe easiest way to plant a low-maintenance garden is to make native plants that do not require regular pruning, deadheading, or water. Plants that are built to survive in your environment will require the least care. Then, look at raised beds or other vertical gardens that will keep weeding to a minimum."

The best closet design companies help buyers create a closet that will serve all of their organizational needs.\nWhile some companies design and install the product for the customer, others take a more do-it-yourself approach by allowing you to both lay out and install the components yourself. What's more, you can use their services in closets throughout your home (yep, including your overflowing pantry). Read on for the best closet design companies that cover every budget and need, and that are available nationwide.\nThe Best Closet Design Companies We’ve Found Online for You\nBest Overall: The Container Store\nBest Upgrade Pick: California Closets\nBest Budget-Friendly Option: Ikea\nBest DIY Option: EasyClosets\nBest Overall: The Container Store\nThe Container Store\nBuy on The Container Store\nKey Specs\nDesign Service: Free professional consultation\nInstallation: DIY for Elfa system only; must use their professional installers for Avera and Preston systems\nWarranty: Limited lifetime warranty\nWhy We Chose It\nThe Container Store is a leader for custom closets, providing excellent organizing essentials across the country.\nPros & Cons\nPros\n95 stores nationwide\nWide variety of price points and storage solutions\nCons\nHigher shipping costs if you're not near a store location\nOverview\nThe Container Store wins big points among users for its flexibility in terms of its variety of layouts, finishes, and costs. The nationwide brand is perhaps best known for its workhorse Elfa organizing system, which comes in the Classic and slightly pricier Decor models, but it also offers the upgraded options of the Avera and Preston systems.\nElfa models make use of adjustable, wall-hanging steel components (and in the case of the Decor model, solid wood) to help optimize closet storage with hanging, shoe shelves, bins, and racks.\nThe Avera system goes for the built-in look with its premium materials and includes amenity components like optional LED lighting. The priciest system, Preston, offers the most custom and upgraded finishes such as tempered glass-fronted soft-close cabinet doors and soft-close drawers.\nThe Container Store offers in-store as well as virtual design consultations that help buyers lay out their closets and choose the system that will work best for them. Customers who live outside of a 25-mile radius of a brick-and-mortar Container Store will incur additional freight and installation fees.\nBest Upgrade Pick: California Closets\nCalifornia Closets\nBuy on Californiaclosets.com\nKey Specs\nDesign Service: Free professional consultation; online design tool for modular system\nInstallation: DIY with videos and guidelines for modular system; must use their installers for all else\nWarranty: Lifetime warranty for custom designs; limited one-year warranty for modular system\nWhy We Chose It\nCalifornia Closets has a strong nationwide network with independent design consultants across the country to assist in areas where it doesn’t have a brick-and-mortar location.\nPros & Cons\nPros\nVirtual home consultations mean every project is customized\nLaminated composite shelves from recycled wood fiber\nCons\nCost planning is tricky because everything is custom\nOverview\nThe Cadillac of closet design companies, California Closets will customize an organization system for nearly any need. Not only does the nationwide brand design reach-in and walk-in closets, but it also designs other forms of storage such as Murphy beds, wine bars, workstations, and entertainment centers.\nWhile California Closets does have a brick-and-mortar presence, it also employs design consultants across the country who do at-home and virtual consultations to help clients design their organization systems based on style, as well as space and budget constraints.\nThe initial design consultation typically lasts approximately 90 minutes. From there, a design is finalized and then takes generally between four and six weeks to be fabricated. The custom closet is then installed by California Closets. The cost for storage varies based on the complexity of projects and the materials and finishes used, but the cost includes the materials, finishes, installation, and a lifetime warranty.\nAll of California Closets’ boards are made with a laminated composite made from recycled wood fiber, and all systems are mounted to the walls.\nBest Budget-Friendly Option: Ikea\nIKEA\nBuy on Ikea\nKey Specs\nDesign Service: Online design tool\nInstallation: DIY with guidelines; Taskrabbit partnership\nWarranty: None, but can return unopened packages up to 365 days after purchase\nWhy We Chose It\nThe quality of construction, combination options, and affordability of Ikea’s Boaxel system surpasses other budget picks.\nPros & Cons\nPros\nAffordable\nWell-constructed\nEasy to install\nCons\nSome may find it less attractive than other organizational systems\nOverview\nIkea retired its popular Algot system in 2020, but the internationally beloved home brand has replaced it with an equally worthy contender in the Boaxel system.\nThe Boaxel system uses a powder-coated carbon steel wall-mounted frame as its jumping-off point. Ikea sells pre-determined storage combinations, such as sets that include hanging space on top of mesh drawers, as well as individual parts for creating a more personalized layout.\nIkea’s complementary Jonaxel system is a great pick for renters or those with too little closet space, as it's freestanding and doesn’t require wall-mounting. The systems can also be used together.\nThat said, the minimalist design may not suit all buyers. But the wall-hanging organization system will get the job done—and at a relatively reasonable price.\nBest DIY Option: EasyClosets\nEasyClosets\nBuy on Easyclosets.com\nKey Specs\nDesign Service: Free professional consultation; online design tool\nInstallation: DIY only, with PDF guidelines and online videos\nWarranty: Limited lifetime warranty\nWhy We Chose It\nEasyClosets allows buyers across the country to design their ideal closet from the comfort of their home.\nPros & Cons\nPros\nReal-time price calculator\nOffers a handful of different finish options\nCons\nInstallation may challenge some customers\nOverview\nEasyClosets is a web-based purveyor of organizational systems that gives buyers the option to custom design their own closet.

Most companies combine modular components to achieve this, like The Container Store and Ikea, while others such as California Closets take a more customized approach.\nHow much does a custom closet increase home value?\nCustom closets can definitely increase the value of your home. The amount of value added will depend on the quality of the materials used, the quality of craftmanship, and the size and extent of customization, if any.\nWhat is the average cost of custom closets?\nThe cost of a custom closet will depend on the size of the closet you’re trying to build and the level of customization. Better materials are obviously going to cost more, and extra details equate to extra money. Costs can start at $1,000 or $2,000 and go past $10,000. With that said, most customized closet prices fall within the $3,500 to $5,000 range.\nWhat is the best material for a custom closet?\nFor their durability and attractiveness, wood and melamine (a blend of organic chemical compounds and wood that is stronger and lighter than pure wood, but just as attractive) are the two best materials for custom closets.\nMethodology\nWe reviewed customer reports as well as online installation guides and product reviews to assemble a list of closet design companies that provide customized organizational systems at various price levels. While there are many local designers and brands that provide closet design services, we stipulated that each brand included on our list must be available to customers nationwide. We also looked at the design services a company provides, whether or not DIY installation is allowed, and the kind of warranty provided."

Make sure you have enough clearance on all sides. Consider a small square or narrow rectangular in an L-shaped, U-shaped, or open kitchen. A freestanding island on wheels is another small kitchen solution.\nWhat is the smallest size a kitchen island can be?\nThere is no minimum or maximum size for a kitchen island, which should be proportional with your space. But in general a kitchen island should ideally be no less than about 2x4 feet in order to be functional, allowing for a few feet of clearance around it on all sides to ensure that it doesn’t disrupt the flow of your kitchen.\nIs it less expensive to buy or build a kitchen island?\nIn general, it is less expensive to build your own kitchen island, according to HomeAdvisor. The ultimate cost will depend on everything from your choice of materials to labor costs if you hire someone to build a custom island for you rather than purchasing a prefab model or DIY'ing it."

  "articleText": "HOME DESIGN & DECORATING DECORATING FURNITURE\n55 Brilliant Entertainment Center Ideas\nBy LAUREN MURPHY\nPublished on 03/09/22\nExperienceInteriors / Getty Images\nIf the kitchen is the heart of the home, the living room is the nervous system. Entertainment centers are a central part of any living room (but can also be found in playrooms, movie rooms, and even bedrooms). They typically hold your television, movies, and various electronic devices, including video game consoles. \nEntertainment centers are centerpieces that get plenty of visual attention, especially if you’re watching a movie, so it’s important that they look their best. The options for designing and decorating your entertainment center are practically limitless. Add a festive garland to celebrate the holidays or a floral arrangement to keep things looking (and smelling) fresh. Whatever your preference, there are plenty of variations to choose from. Here’s some inspiration.\nFace Seating Away\nTry facing couches and chairs toward each other instead of directly at your entertainment center and TV. That encourages more social interaction among your family and house guests and encourages them not to just stare at the TV in silence. You can always rearrange when you’re ready to watch a movie together.\nCover Wires\nPiles of DVDs and tangled cords can instantly make your space look and feel cluttered. Hide them away with cabinet doors on your entertainment center to clean things up a bit. This seemingly simple tactic can make your entertainment center look much more sleek and clean.\nExtra Storage\nAre you a movie buff? Make room for your collection by adding lots of shelves and drawers for extra storage. If you don’t have enough physical copies of movies to fill them up, add other decorations, like books or sculptures.\nFull Wall Entertainment Center\nBuild or buy an entertainment center that perfectly fits the width of your room. The shelving systems will look like built-ins, making your home look classically chic.\nUpgrade Hardware\nIf you’re looking for a way to rejuvenate your current entertainment center for a small amount of money, update the hardware. Buy new drawer pulls to instantly give your entertainment center a brand new look and feel. You can easily interchange the hardware yourself in minutes. Upgrading hardware is an inexpensive and extremely easy way to update the look of any piece of furniture.\nAdd Greenery\nHouseplants are great mood boosters, and they can make any space look fresh and inviting. Add a few plants to your entertainment center for a simple yet sophisticated decor piece. Place smaller plants on the entertainment center itself or consider adding larger potted plants, like fiddle leaf fig trees, on either side of it on the floor.\nClean and Simple Entertainment Center\nConsider mounting your TV, hiding devices, and going with a clean, white entertainment center to tone things down. Screens can be visually noisy, so keeping the things around it simple makes the space a little more relaxing.\nPlace Your Entertainment Center Against a Textured Wall\nAdd interest by placing your entertainment center against a textured wall, like exposed brick or stone. If you don’t already have a textured wall in your home, consider installing a shiplap wall to make one.\nAdd Decorative Shelves\nInstall simple shelves above your entertainment center to place small decorative items, like potted succulents or holiday knick knacks. This will add an adorable touch to your space, making it feel more like home without adding unnecessary clutter to your entertainment center. You won’t have to worry about your decorations getting in the way of the TV, either.\nLight It Up\nIf your entertainment center is the focal point of your room, decorate it so that it stands out. Add string lights around it, which especially looks nice around the holidays, or small tabletop lamps next to the TV to flick on when you want soft lighting.\nSurround It With Shelves\nTelevisions are practically an entertainment necessity these days, but they can look clunky and dark. Allow yours to blend into your entertainment center by surrounding it with shelves. Fill the shelves with interesting decor pieces and lots of books. You can even use the shelves to store your movies (if you still have physical copies, that is). \nHow to Build Floor-to-Ceiling Shelves\nBuffet Entertainment Center\nA buffet table, otherwise known as a sideboard or buffet, is a long and low furniture piece. They’re typically found in dining rooms where they display and store items like serving ware and linens. But these pieces are very versatile. Use yours as a makeshift entertainment center for an entertainment center with a twist.\nBuilt-In Entertainment Center\nInstall your entertainment center so that it's flush with your wall to give it a vintage built-in look. Doing this will make room for your TV and entertainment center without cramping the living room, which will save valuable floor space.\nDecorate With Floating Shelves\nFloating shelves are a great way to decorate without cluttering your space. Add a few above your entertainment center and place photos, decorations, or anything else you want on them. Shelving above your entertainment center will draw the eye up and relieve some of the attention your entertainment center gets, allowing you to keep its decor clean and simple.\nCover It With Curtains\nEntertainment centers don’t always match your home’s look, especially if you’re going for a very minimalist style. Solve this problem by installing a curtain rod across the entirety of your room and hanging a soft, flowy curtain. Use the curtains to cover up your entertainment center when you’re not using it.\nApply Statement Wallpaper\nBring your living space to life with statement wallpaper, like wallpaper with a bold print or an intricate design. This will liven things up without making it look too busy. Since you’ll be staring at your entertainment center anyway, why not add some extra style?\nIf you’re a renter and wallpaper isn’t an option, you can still get this look. There are plenty of retailers who sell removable wallpaper or decals that you can take off before you move out without worrying about ruining the paint.\nBlack and White Theme\nMost televisions are matte black or very dark gray. Decorate around your TV with contrasting furniture and decor, like a crisp white entertainment center and white walls. Add a few black furniture pieces throughout the room to keep it visually interesting.\nOff-Center Television\nTypically, your TV is the centerpiece of your entertainment center. Go against the grain and place it off-centered so that it isn’t the focal point of the piece. Decorate with plants, photos, cabinets, and other pieces to draw the eye all around the entertainment center.\nGo Retro\nIf you’re going for a mid-century modern look, consider thrifting a vintage television and side table to act as your entertainment center. This is especially great if you’re not an avid TV-watcher because older televisions are fairly small.\nHidden Cabinets\nEntertainment centers can be bulky. If you have a small space, bulky furniture pieces are a big no. Utilize the built-in entertainment style and paint your storage cabinets the same color as the wall, essentially hiding them from plain view.\nInset Entertainment Center\nSet your TV and entertainment center into the wall and add an accent piece, like a colorful panel, behind it. You won’t be able to stop staring at your entertainment center, even when the TV is off.\nTV Cutout\nConsider adding a TV-shaped cutout in your wall to place your television. Underneath, you can install cabinets, either built-in or not, to hold the accessories you would put in any typical entertainment center.\nAdd Statement Art\nDecorate your entertainment center with a statement art piece that matches the look of your home. This will prevent the entertainment center (and your big, black television) from sticking out like a sore thumb. With a statement art piece, your entertainment center will blend into the rest of your decor. Make your own art to save money.\nEntertainment Center With Sliding Dors\nInstall sliding doors on your entertainment center, no matter what its material is. Add modern hardware to make the piece look classy and use the sliding doors to hide your wires and not-so-aesthetic accessories, like movies and video games. \nCombined Furniture Pieces\nCombine multiple shelving units of the same aesthetic (maybe even the same brand) to create your own one-of-a-kind entertainment center. Use a combination of bookshelves, dressers, and TV stands for a multi-functional piece.\nSmall Shelves Under Mounted TV\nSeparate your television and cabinet-style entertainment center with a strip or two of thin shelves. The shelves can hold things like DVD players or video game consoles, keeping the top of your entertainment center clean and making room for decor pieces if you’d like to add some interest.\nSmall Wooden Entertainment Center\nEntertainment centers range significantly in size. To tone things down in your space, opt for a small entertainment center. Some people think TVs instantly make a space less cozy, so choose a wooden entertainment center to incorporate more natural materials and coziness. Small and wooden is the ultimate combination.\nLayered Entertainment Center\nCreate your own entertainment center by layering furniture pieces. Place a long dresser or shelf system on the floor for storage, mount your TV above it, and install a cabinet system above that. You’ll have plenty of storage space for your belongings and enough room to hide unsightly wires, too.\nCorner Entertainment Center\nIt can be tough to arrange your dream living room in a small space. Corner entertainment centers help solve that problem. They’re specifically designed to fit perfectly in the corner of a room, which is normally a difficult area to furnish. That frees up the rest of the space in your home for important furniture pieces, like sofas.\nRepurposed Vintage Crate\nMake your own entertainment center with a vintage crate. You can often find vintage crates at your local thrift store. Find one that’s in relatively good shape (or restore it yourself), add legs if needed, and voila! You’ve got your own shabby chic entertainment center.\nDIY Pallet Entertainment Center\nWood pallets are relatively easy to find—they’re commonly used for shipping, and most retailers don’t have a need for them after they’ve received their products. Ask around and find a free one. Pallets are extremely versatile, and they make excellent DIY entertainment centers.\nRepaint Thrifted Furniture\nRefreshing thrifted furniture is eco-friendly and inexpensive. With some sanding, a few coats of paint, and sealant, you can have an entertainment center that looks as good as new. DIYing your own piece also allows you to customize it to match your room’s current aesthetic.\nAdd a Decorative Ladder\nIf your entertainment center is tall and wide, consider using its shelves to display your favorite books. Add a ladder to make it look even more like a miniature library. Just specify whether or not it’s functional to visitors.\nAllow Air to Circulate\nElectronic devices get hot when they’re running, so consider placing your entertainment center a few inches away from the wall to increase ventilation and prevent your devices from overheating.\nBarn Door Entertainment Center\nBarn doors are door panels hung from the top on a horizontal rod that allows them to swing from side to side to open and close. They are a trendy alternative to the classic hinged doors and look great in farmhouse style homes. Use this tactic on your entertainment center to give it a rustic feel.\nTransformed Dresser Entertainment Center\nInstead of going out to purchase a piece of furniture specified as an entertainment center, repurpose a dresser. This could be the dresser from your old bedroom, a thrifted piece, or even a brand new one. If needed, transform it with a coat of paint and updated hardware to make it look super stylish.\nCube Shelf Entertainment Center\nCube shelves are popular for storing things like books, toys, and even craft supplies. There’s really no limit to what you can put in them. Transform your cube shelves into a makeshift entertainment center. Use the cubbies to hold all of your accessories and decor pieces.\nReclaimed Wood Entertainment Center\nIf you love the environment, you’ll love using reclaimed wood to make an entertainment center. Visit your local reuse store or use scrap wood from your woodshop to create your very own simple entertainment center out of reclaimed wood. This DIY is both eco-friendly and budget-friendly.\nShiplap Built-Ins\nSome older homes come with built-in shelving that makes the space look classic and streamlined, not cluttered. If your house doesn’t have them, don’t worry. You can make your own with shiplap, an easy-to-work-with wall material made up of white panels. When put together, shiplap creates a muted stripe pattern. The pattern is subtle and simple yet stylish and modern.\nHang Art\nHang a piece of art above your entertainment center to bring more attention to the space. Choose a piece from your favorite artist or channel your inner Picasso and paint one yourself. Either way, make sure the colors match the rest of your space so everything ties in nicely.\nStore Accessories in Fabric Bins\nYou can soften things up by using fabric bins or wicker baskets in place of cabinets and drawers. Simply remove cabinets or drawers from your entertainment center and replace them with the bins or consider purchasing a new entertainment center with space for them. Bins and baskets create a more natural look, but they still provide ample storage space for all of your things.\nIndustrial Shelving Entertainment Center\nIndustrial shelves are surprisingly simple to DIY. In just a weekend, you can make your own. You can even use reclaimed wood as the shelf material to make it a more budget-friendly DIY.\nSimple DIY Entertainment Center\nBuild your own DIY entertainment center that’s strong enough to hold your TV and has the storage space to hide your wires and accessories. \nSet up Decorative Bookends\nWhile books can be decorative and stylish on their own, sometimes they need a little sprucing up. Use your entertainment center to display books and decorative bookends. If you don’t already have fun bookends to display, shop for them at your local thrift store or home goods store. There are plenty of options on the market, so you’ll be able to find ones that match your look.\nPersonalize With Photos\nMake your space more your own by adding personal touches, like family photos. Your entertainment center is the perfect surface to place photo frames on. The more, the merrier!\nIf you like displaying your photos elsewhere, you can personalize your entertainment center in other ways. Display your kids’ artwork (or yours) or trophies.\nPlace a Blanket Ladder Nearby\nThere’s not much better than cozying up on the couch to watch a good movie. Adding a blanket or two in the mix is even better. Your blankets can double as functional decor, too. Display them with a blanket ladder to make your living space feel even cozier and to keep your blankets within reach the next time you want to curl up for a movie night with your friends.\nLight Candles\nLighting candles is a great way to improve the ambiance in any space. Add one (or multiple) to your entertainment center to light on cozy days indoors. You can make your own candles with a few simple supplies or buy your own from your favorite home goods store. \nBrands & Collections We Love\nFrame the TV\nMake your TV stand out by framing it. You can do this in a few different ways. You could literally frame it with a DIY or custom frame or you can place a decorative backboard behind it to help it stand out. \nTo make a decorative backboard, nail or glue multiple pieces of reclaimed wood side by side. Install it on the wall above your entertainment center and mount your TV over top to make it pop. Then store your things in a cabinet-style entertainment center below it.\nHide TV Behind Cabinet Doors\nChoose an entertainment center with cabinet doors that can close over your TV. That way, you can hide it when you’re not using it. \nArmoire Entertainment Center\nUsing an armoire as an entertainment center is a great option if you like to hide your TV on occasion for whatever reason. Some people prefer to hide their TV because it takes up valuable decorating space while others prefer to make their space look free of modern electronics. Either way, an armoire will help you achieve the look you want.\nIKEA Hack\nIKEA is a relatively inexpensive furniture store, so it’s no surprise that there are plenty of DIY tutorials out there instructing consumers how to “hack” their products. That involves making them over to personalize them and make them look even more stylish. Purchase multiple IKEA pieces, like bookshelves and dressers, and combine them to make the ultimate DIY entertainment center. \nGo Without a TV\nInstead of displaying a television, display a fabulous work of art or a beautiful potted plant on your entertainment center. Without a TV, you won’t be putting extra focus on electronics (which some people don’t love). You can always watch a movie on your laptop or consider using a portable TV that you take out only when you need it.\nAdd Seasonal Garlands\nRotating your decorations seasonally keeps things fresh and interesting. Add a seasonal garland to your entertainment center to keep it looking up-to-date and trendy. Purchase or make your own holiday garland in the winter, flower garland in the spring, shell garland in the summer, and a garland of maple leaves in autumn. You can also make garlands out of cranberries and dried oranges, which look and smell wonderful during the holidays.\nBamboo Entertainment Center\nBamboo is a strong, natural material that’s often used to make furniture. If your first priority when it comes to home decor is sustainability, opt for a bamboo entertainment center.\nKeep It In Sight\nSet up your entertainment center so that it's level with your line of sight from the couch. This will make watching a movie a much more enjoyable experience because you'll be able to properly focus on the television without maneuvering around or craning your neck."

  "articleText": "HOME NEWS HOME TRENDS\n4 TikTok-Approved Board Game Organizing Hacks for the Holidays\nFrom transparent mesh bags to a pan rack\nBy CHRISTIANNA SILVA Published on 11/28/23\nKonstantin Aksenov / Getty Images\nThere are a few activities that are a given at almost every family gathering during the holidays: eating, maybe watching a festive movie, and definitely playing a board game.\nBut there’s one problem with that very fun, and sometimes chaotic, last pick. Games can cause a lot of clutter in your home, and during a time of year that's already known for adding clutter to your space, it’s important to know how to organize your games in a short amount of time.\nGame cupboards are notoriously messy because most board games come in big, clunky boxes, and none of the boxes are ever the same size. Thankfully, we found some tips and tricks on TikTok to ensure you get to keep the fun and games without all the clutter.\nIKEA KALLAX\nMany board game enthusiasts keep their board games in IKEA KALLAX shelving units—the ones that feature big boxes for shelves. Because you can buy the KALLAX shelving units in a range of different colors and sizes, you can set these up to match the exact number of board games you own, or are hoping to collect. These work great if you want to have your board games on display.\nMesh Bags\nIf you want to have your board games organized but don’t want to buy any additional furniture, there are dozens of people on TikTok who have the perfect answer: mesh bags.\n“I hate that board game boxes are big, bulky, and all different sizes, so I found this pack of pouches on Amazon to get them organized,” Kelssey Layton said in one TikTok video. Layton says that because the pouches are see-through and waterproof, it’s easy to find your favorite game and keep it safe. \nOne creator on TikTok used a label maker to ensure she knew exactly which game she was pulling out, while another cut apart the title of the game from the board game box and taped that to the front of the mesh bag. \nAfter you put your games in the mesh bag, you can toss those back into the cabinet you were keeping your games in, put them in a storage bin, or toss them in a box. \nCloset Organizer\nAnother TikTok creator used a hanging closet organizer to keep her board games from getting too messy. Simply hang the closet organizer up and place about three games in each box.\nA Pan Rack\nIn one particularly brilliant hack on TikTok, one user uses a pan rack to organize her board games. That way, you can take out one game without making the whole pile fall.\nWhether it's the sleek IKEA KALLAX shelving units that embrace your board games in a colorful array or the practicality of transparent, waterproof mesh bags for easy identification, TikTok has board game organization hacks covered. As the final move is made on the board, tidy up however you see fit."
