Failure to deliver was IKEA's fault and they were not willing to go a little out of the way to agree on a more convenient option. I'll be on vacation and therefore will not be here on the date IKEA proposed. This was IKEA's mistake and, in spite of this, they were not willing to alter their system a bit to rectify a situation they created. They kept saying their system would not accept it. The only option offered was reimbursement, which is what I had to do. More than three weeks waiting for delivery, measurements taken to be sure the items would fit, in summary, all the time lost for nothing. I will not buy at IKEA again."

We deeply appreciate your kind efforts in providing a conducive & comfortable dining area for all & a prayer room for the Muslims - thank you! You are a very good example of an organization that understands & cares for the important aspects of people in a multiracial society like Singapore.The restaurant also provides Halal food for the Muslims. It would be good if there could be a wider variety in the Halal menu - as a majority of  non-Muslims can also enjoy the Halal food. This will attract & encourage more Muslims to come to shop & enjoy the food offered. In the many weeks & months we have been here, we found that the Halal menu is hardly changed or not changed as regularly as it should. You could perhaps include salads, soups, salmon/ fishes & also other desserts too.As the restaurant is very popular with the shoppers, you could perhaps consider expanding the restaurant area to the entrance of the showrooms."

  "articleText": "A year and a half ago, while living in Greece, we ordered from an IKEA shop in Thessaloniki. It was supposed to be delivered in a couple of days, but it took more than a month! That time the staff referred to some problem with the \"system\". Ok, whatever. Being late is not considered such a serious offence in Greece.But history repeats itself, this time in Belgium.Last week, on 27/11, we placed an order number 1480812052 at the IKEA Wilrijk shop. It was supposed to be delivered today, 02/12. Of course, nothing was delivered. No one even warned us that there was no point in sitting at home all day waiting for the order. After a long (more than an hour) wait for a reply in chat, we were told that our order was \"stuck in the system\". Ok, probably right in the middle. So, once again, it was nobody's fault but the proverbial \"system\".As a result, our order was assigned a different number (1482990540) and its delivery was postponed for 4 days. Well, we'll have to sit at home for another day waiting. Will our order arrive, or will we have to wait a month for it, as it was in Greece? We'll see.It seems to me that the company's policy is to blame for this situation. It allows customers to place more orders via the website than the shops are able to process. And in the case of customer enquiries, the employees are forced to blame \"the system\"."

  "articleText": "We hired IKEA to design and install our kitchen, and it’s been a nightmare from the start. After months of back-and-forth, with multiple incorrect drawings and repeated errors, we finally thought the installation was on track. IKEA assured us the kitchen would be delivered two days before installation, but weeks later, the boxes are still sitting in my home.The initial install date of November 4th was delayed to the 12th, yet today is the 12th, and no one has shown up. Despite calling IKEA multiple times, we received no follow-up. We were repeatedly promised call-backs that never happened.With two young children, having no kitchen for weeks is beyond inconvenient—it’s unbearable. IKEA’s lack of communication and accountability has turned this process into a complete disaster. I expect much more from a company of this size. Avoid their kitchen service if you value your time and sanity."

The fitting team got different dates for taking the old  kitchen out and fitting the new kitchen. There was a delay and now again there is a delay.

Original delivery date, the delivery never turned up, I phoned customer service to be told the truck it was on had broken down.. sure.So the whole order is repurchased by Ikea and a new delivery date is set, it gets delivered a day before the fitters arrive instead of a week. Fitters show up and can’t do anything due to missing items from the delivery, no cupboard stands or anything. Fitters leave and we await the delivery of the missing items, these arrive in loads of different delivery’s and boxes forcing our neighbours to take in loads of different parcels.Fitters take ages to be rearranged due to the incompetence of Ikea, they arrive one day without even informing us they were booked to arrive! They finally arrive at a date we were informed of just to tell us they are still missing items from the order and that his apprentice was supposed to account for those items?Unacceptable.So we’ve been left without a kitchen for over 8 weeks, no running water as we don’t have a tap or anything. Customer service are absolutely useless, at least an hours wait on the phone before you can even speak to someone.Please please get your kitchen from somewhere else! What was supposed to be an exciting time of our first kitchen for our first house is now just dread, worry and constant frustrating phone calls. Worst experience ever."

  "articleText": "I've seen a lot of crappy customer service but IKEA is the worst. Had a pickup delivery with a 2h window, the diver arrived 30 minutes late and took another 15 minutes to hand out the orders. A ceramic plant pot that I ordered was damaged and he kept it and told me to get in touch with customer service instead of just initiating a refund automatically. The order doesn't even show up in my online profile, there is no contact email, chat doesn't work, on the Messenger chat nobody is answering, hotline is 30+ minutes wait time. There is literally no way to get in touch with support at all. Hard to believe how deep they've sunk. Don't order from IKEA!"

First, I paid for a furniture installation service, but the item arrived damaged, and your team was unable to resolve the issue. I was informed it would take some time to replace, and I expected it to be completed within a week, as is standard procedure. However, it has now been over a month, and my furniture is still unfinished in my home, awaiting repair. This is unacceptable, especially given the significant amount paid for this service.Secondly, the quality of your shipping service is subpar. The delivery personnel seem untrained and unprepared, causing unnecessary delays and wasting valuable time. This lack of professionalism is both frustrating and disappointing."

When the product arrived, several crucial pieces were missing. After contacting customer service, they assured me the missing parts would be sent, but they never showed up. Weeks later, I was told that the parts were unavailable and was left with two terrible choices: either disassemble the dresser I had already spent hours assembling or keep an incomplete, useless product.I had no choice but to take apart the dresser, haul it back to the store, and process a refund. The whole ordeal was exhausting and beyond frustrating. What should have been a simple purchase turned into a time-consuming, stressful experience. The lack of care from customer service and the failure to provide a solution made this the worst product purchase experience I’ve ever had.I expected much better from IKEA, but I’ll definitely think twice before buying from them again."

  "articleText": "I've been a loyal IKEA customer for years and have always appreciated their designs and affordability. However, my recent experience has been disappointing. I purchased the FRIHETEN sofa-bed, and initially, it was a great addition to our home—comfortable and functional.After about 2.5 years of normal use by two adults (no kids or pets), the sofa started showing significant wear. The cushions sagged, foam pieces began falling into the storage compartment, and eventually, metal springs snapped and protruded through the material on one side.When I reached out to IKEA customer service, I was informed that the damage was due to misuse and improper maintenance, so it wasn't covered under their 10-year guarantee. This was frustrating because we used the sofa exactly as intended and took good care of it.While I still appreciate some aspects of IKEA, this experience has left me questioning the durability of their products and the support provided when issues arise. I hope IKEA addresses these concerns for future customers."

We awaited the kitchen and when it did not appear contacted customer services. Several long calls later and told that several items were no longer available, such as the dishwasher ( that we assumed wrongly would be reserved for us as we had paid for it), the oven and several other small items. We were told that they could cancel so that we could reorder but this would affect the installation date. We have ordered lighting and worktops from a different supplier that have arrived for the install. I have arranged annual leave for the installation. No offer to compensate.

I booked a tradesman to build the item and the night before they text me with a new delivery date and time with no explanation. I called the helpline and the lady was not helpful at all. They have not offered me any help other than cancel the order and be refunded in the next 14 days ! Well I made the order because I needed it not to have to wait 14days for my money back so I can use it to shop elsewhere. I will never order from them again just be warned."

No. On delivery date morning, they call me and inform me some items i chose are out of stock! Bullshite. Next, the delivery that was supposed to happen in the evening never happened. Worse was when i contacted their customer service. No one picks up the call. Secondly, whatsapp chat is pointless, you are talking to a bot.

  "articleTitle": "Ikea is good BUT the shipping company used: awful",
  "articleText": "TLDR version: IKEA is great, it is their in-home delivery service I had a major issue with and will never use again, because of the shipping company used.I have recently experienced an ordeal which prevents me from rating one of otherwise really nice stores higher. Actually, I am only giving three stars at all just because I am rating IKEA, not the delivery fiasco. IKEA is nice. Their customer support did their best. In the end, they did all they could, really, and once I cancelled the (probably cursed) order, they returned my money straight away with no problem, I went to IKEA myself, and picked up at least a bed with no issues, quickly, and with the staff on site being really kind and helpful. But before this happy ending, a literal nightmare took place over the course of 3 (or 4, don't remember anymore) days. Thing is, I moved to the US from Europe. And because I was moving into an unfurnished apartment, I turned to IKEA to purchase some starting necessities like a bed with a mattress and sheets, some basic cookware, a bin, some glasses... things you don't pack when you're moving overseas. Because I needed a US phone number, which of course I couldn't get before getting to the US, I used an app that could give me a temporary US phone number, and my goal was to arrange a normal US SIM a soon as I arrived. Everything went smoothly, I ordered an in-apartment delivery for my move-in date. Unfortunately, the day of, I found out the app doesn't work and I couldn't access my temp phone number. I immediately called IKEA, a few hours before the supposed delivery, hoping I will be able to get a message across to the driver of the truck to call a different number which I was able to arrange upon my arrival. IKEA informed me that for these deliveries, they cannot change the phone number once the delivery was placed. Thus ended my first call with them. I called again and asked if anything can be done at all, like them giving me contact info for the delivery company. They did not, but made a note in their system with the new number. Nobody called me, and the delivery was noted as failed a little while later, so I called IKEA again (call number 3, still okay-ish), asking what happened and if they could put me in touch with anyone in the shipping company to hopefully get the message across to the driver. They did, and I started calling the shipping company. This is where my patience started wearing thin, because for such a simple thing as a different phone number, there appeared to be no solution. The customer service kept telling me what they cannot do and what IKEA must do, so I kept calling back and forth with both, resulting in no less than 18 (yes, bloody EIGHTEEN) calls with customer support of IKEA and the shipping company. The shipping company kept asking IKEA to change the number in many different ways, and IKEA kept doing it and helping me as best they could but still the driver apparently kept calling the old number on a total of four (as far as I can recall, could have been more) failed delivery attempts. When the situation started to come truly full circle, I have decided that repeating the same pattern and expecting a different result would indeed be a sign of insanity, and called IKEA for a final time to cancel the order. Before that, I called the shipping company to inform them that unless the driver calls the correct number and delivers my stuff that very day, I won't be able to receive the goods anyway because I started at my new job on the next business day and will not have time to wait for a call that is not coming at home anymore. They tried to persuade me to still wait, but were unable to give me any specifications or assurances the driver will indeed call the correct phone number that by that time has been probably plastered all over every piece of documentation regarding that order by both IKEA and, if one could believe them, the shipping company. At that point I just wanted my bed, and to not sleep on a borrowed air mattress anymore, so I said I do not care anymore, cancelled the order and just asked a friend to help me get some of the stuff in person."

We called IKEA again to find out the delivery I been told over the phone, you should have your OVEN why didn’t they delivered and asked me are you available tomorrow so we can deliver, and I said yes please do so, I waited the whole day nothing happened. I called IKEA again to find out and I been told to wait until 7 October to receive your delivery. Today is 11 October and I have not received my delivery yet, so I called them and they said sorry we doo not have the item in stook you need to wait until 18 October once we receive the item in stook then call back.

  "articleTitle": "About the return",
  "articleText": "(I write using English translate)Yesterday I went to Ikea Vaughan branch to return 2 arm chairs that I bought 10 months ago and never took out of their boxes. They were in their original boxes, I bought them as a gift, but I couldn't take them to the person I bought them from, I didn't have a big car for the return. We only cut off the robes. I went thinking the return period was 365 days but they said they wouldn't take them. The person at the cash register was named Meyar, she was very rude. They didn't care about us because our English was bad. The only thing she said was the word no. Then his supervisor came and he said definitely couldn't take them. Then another manager came and looked at the product and said she could take it back but give store credit. Then another manager came and said the same thing, we didn't want it and while they were there checking the return policy, they first said they were open until 9 o'clock and you can wait, but then when a few customers supported us, they told us to leave Ikea or they would call the police, my husband and I said call them, we are not causing any problems, we are just here to get our rights. Of course we waited there and they couldn't call the police because we didn't do anything wrong. The customers there said they listened to the issue and were sorry about the situation, how immoral it was to threaten us with the police and that they would write a complaint to IKEA. Now we expect a solution from you, if you can return a product that we never use, why don't you refund my money. We have shopped from you for years, we wanted to have a kitchen built but I have decided never to buy products from IKEA from now on."

The second delivery was late and then not delivered at all because DHL cannot find my apartment. I called IKEA to explain that if the first delivery was without problem, how came that it didn't work out for the 2nd delivery. They ignored my complaint, and told me to order the second time. What I found disappointing is that I already paid 90 EUR for the delivery fees, and with the new reorder, IKEA told me to pay the delivery fee by myself. I find the service very bad. With this solution, why should the customer care department exist? I hope that IKEA can improve their logistics and especially customer service soon, to retain loyal customers."

After 6 weeks (the usual wait time for dekton kitchen worktops to be cut and delivered) the installer found that the side had been cut incorrectly.  Since then IKEA have ghosted me.  I have called multiple times, always at least 30 mins before I get to speak to someone to find out that 'someone is working on it they will call back'; 12 weeks later and neither me nor the installation company that was sub-contracted can get any information as to when it might be finished.  IKEA even told the installation company that I never answer calls and emails! Absolutely disgusting after sales.  I have found no way to escalate the problem and am left with an unfinished kitchen and ongoing stress of wondering if the problem will ever be solved."

Now it is two week later, and still there is no refund. Today I called, and a representative tried to explain about the refund, but he also told me that my purchased items were still available for pick up for a couple days after 24 hours of the deadline. When we called first time nobody told us about that. I had to spent another 600$ to buy the same furniture in the store because refund wasn't available from IKEA. They also could covert my money into a gift card, which I could receive online and use for the purchase of the same furniture in the store. Nobody did anything except the last representative who tried to calculate the days, and tell me when I will be getting my money back.

Customer service has been absolutely useless, offering no clear answers or resolution. Every time I call, they can’t provide any helpful information or a timeline for when I’ll get the dishwasher. The lack of communication, follow-up, and basic accountability is incredibly frustrating.This has been the worst shopping experience I’ve ever had, and I regret choosing IKEA for such a major purchase. I wouldn’t recommend their services to anyone, especially for large, expensive items like kitchen orders. They seem completely unprepared to handle issues, and their customer support is a nightmare."

Exchange was impossible as the product was out of stock and I chose another one which was scheduled to be delivered three days later (11Oct24). Fabulous! Everything was swift and hassle free. Three days later, the heaven turned out to be hell.With help, I pushed the 10 inch King size mattress from bedroom to living room. Waited a whole day with constant online check. At 1852, I called and was told there would be no delivery as the new mattress was out of stock. The earliest stock may be available on 14Oct and I have to call the hotline to check the stock and arrange for delivery. I told them why didn’t they come and collect the return mattress first and deliver the new one after the stock replenish. Been answered they could not do it and if I wanted a separate collection, it would be 6 days later. No updates on the stock and no buffer for any delivery or collection. I would need to push the mattress up to bedroom or dare sleeping in the living room for a week. What a service!Update: IKEA missed its second delivery, hour before the SMS claimed its arrival. Called twice to ask with no avail. Only answered it was their company policy. Started to stress out with IKEA, Even cancelling order needed at least two phone calls, still no confidence when and how the service will be done. Absolute nightmare."

The latest issue is trying to change a delivery date by one day, the message I keep receiving \"Sorry, there's an unexpected problem with the rescheduling system at the moment.

When we unpacked a couple of the boxes, we discovered marks all over the wood (it turns out it's the wood knots and with the thin paint on top, it looks like there are lots of dirty marks everywhere). We then organised a collection / delivery of the faulty pieces, thinking that was all fine. Then I received a confirmation email and noticed that they have noted down the wrong items for exchange, but after a phone call, we were told that all has been ammended and everything was fine.Cue the delivery date, I phone in the morning to get a time estimate (as it's a 12 HOURS long slot), and I'm told \"everything is fine\" and they'll let me know when the delivery will take place. Several hours pass, and I phone again to get a timing, and that's when I'm told that the collection has been cancelled - because of the original issue with the bar codes of items having been wrong. No warning, no communication. The delivery of the exchange items has been remade without checking with me, and now the collection can only be re-arranged for a week's time.I explained that having all these boxes in my home everywhere is really difficult and that given it's their mistake on several counts (faulty product, mistake noting the car codes of items for exchange, cancelling the collection with no communication), it's really for them to resolve. This is the part that I'm the most shocked by, there was literally no flexibility, and a \"it's your issue to deal with, not ours\" attitude. I asked to speak to someone else and was told that that I couldn't do that, as they would just say the same thing. Effectively it was too bad, and I'd just have to lump it.I'm now left with a room full of boxes, having spent all day during the children's half term at home waiting, and just a really unpleasant feeling about how badly IKEA treat their customers. I know IKEA is good value for money but I wouldn't order from them again, as if it goes wrong, you're on your own!"

Better sell on online marketplace.Offered a king sized bed (RRP €200) in perfect condition on Marktplaats (local classifieds marketplace) for €110. Got 3 offers, accepted first, last minute no-show. Renovating -> quick sale desirable -> let's try the IKEA buyback program, online offer €100 following their terms. Disassemble bed, load to a car, travel to IKEA Amersfoort. Long wait (as always on their CS to be fair), then we were asked to assemble again to be considered. Sure, it was mentioned we need to 'deliver the product assembled', not really possible for 180x200 bed, but anyway. We put it together. The guy, Mateo, danced around for 5 minutes and finally found a single hairline ca 8 mm long \"scratch\" on the back side between joints (most likely a manufacture issue, second employee was unable to find for 2 minutes even though he knew which side of the bed to look at, see picture below). Smug smile \"good shape, you'll get €75\". \"No, that's not what your terms say.\" \"I'm not here to discuss, it's a large piece, it'll take a lot of space, accept 75 or you can take it back home.

  "articleText": "For the first time in many years, I went to the Wednesbury branch a couple of times in the last week, to get ideas for a kitchen extension.1. Plenty of great ideas for kitchens, organising etc. Well thought out stuff.2. Their very short standard lengths of laminate worktops are well priced. The moment you go over the standard length by even a cm, as many people will as the standard lengths are so short, the price triples.3. The Kungsfors range of shelves, suspension rails and organisation is excellent and a huge centrepiece of Ikea kitchen organisation - but bizarrely, there's not a single example of the shelf system set up in any of their kitchens, or any demonstration of their versatility.4. Too many (all?) of their kitchens on display are completely without mock electricity sockets. It gives an unrealistic view of organising the worktop space and walls above it.5. I hated visiting Ikea in the past because once in, it is very difficult to leave - few exit signs, a long walk to get out. It's like a nightmare you struggle to wake up from. Their buildings always gives me a nauseating, sick feeling, very claustrophobic.6. If you try to order a lot of stuff online, you'll run into delivery and availability issues; some products will be available online but not in a store, and some available in a store but not online, and some will be available in one store but not another. But surely, all products should be available at all times online? Very difficult to order all the items you need without faffing about.7. The restaurant area was dirty on both visits. Too few (I didn't see any) staff clearing up and wiping down tables.8. The stuff I bought on the visits was all well made and complete!"

My fault they were too small but returning them turned out to be a living hell! It was in no way straight forward. I had to purchase the label  myself and I chose USPS as it is what I use in my business. I followed their directions to send it to the closest store since we don't have a store in my city. Sent the return to Tempe AZ. Well nobody at the store would sign for the package so it sat collecting dust at USPS and there was no way for me to contact the actual store as they don't take phone calls! So I am stuck with these crap pads and out of my shipping money and the only way to talk to anyone at ikea is through a chat with people that live in another country that have no power or way to solve my problem whatsover so I am also out of all the time I wasted pretending I could get actual customer service! DON'T BUY ONLINE EVER!!"

  "articleText": "I was supposed to receive a delivery today the 18th between 9am-1pm as stated in the message I received last Friday. At 12:25pm I phoned IKEA in Dublin to query where the delivery was as there wasn't any updates on my online account. I spoke to a man named John who apologised and assured me my delivery was 15 minutes delayed but I would receive it shortly. At 2:06pm I phoned back and was speaking to a different man who told me I probably wouldn't have my delivery today as it actually never even left the hub. So clearly John couldn't be bothered looking into this correctly and fobbed me off. I specifically booked a Sunday delivery to ensure I would be around to receive the order to which now was a complete waste of my day. They told me they could leave the delivery at the front of my house if I wasn't at home but seriously who would willing want to leave over €300 worth of goods out in plain sight for anyone to take. The 2nd man I spoke to told me I would receive an email confirming I would be compensated from IKEA if I didn't have my order by 7pm this evening and surprise surprise that's another lie as I still haven't received the official email. Absolutely shocking service considering they charge enough for delivery. What's the point in booking a specific day if they don't bother sticking to it...... ***UPDATE*** they have now locked me out of MY OWN ACCOUNT"

I was given 4 time frames throughout the day. Constant no shows. I finally get a call from the delivery idiot at 8:23pm saying he would be there in 20 minutes. 20 minutes, no delivery. 9 pm, no delivery. I left my house at 9:15pm but my sister was still there. Mark, the delivery person, said he was there. I asked my sister if this was true. Nope. No delivery truck was there. If IKEA is going to offer delivery, at least get reputable people to do it. Houston IKEA contracted out a \"delivery\" service that delivers absolutely nothing except blatant lies. Houston IKEA and CRST NAL Group should be investigated. I wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing online. IKEA HAS NO IDEA HOW TO OPERATE THIS PART OF THEIR COMPANY. AND THE SAD PART IS THEY DO NOT CARE. One other reviewer mentioned a class action law suit. I'm ready to go. Houston IKEA is AWFUL. And if you see CRST NAL GROUP as the \"delivery\" company for anything, think twice. I'm pretty sure this company is just a company of scammers."

Until it was 7 pm and they said, sorry, something happened, theyre coming tomorrow, and then tomorrow, they never came. Same story. for 2 weeks. I called two to three times daily with their horrible waiting times. Each time they said something different but were consistently clueless about what the last person said. They said they would refund the product but did not. I tried talking to supervisors, but they said they were not allowed to talk to supervisors. Get this: they gave a FAKE email of a supervisor! It was so stressful!  I had to dispute the charge with my credit card! And afterward, guess what? They did come to pick up their items on a Sunday without letting me know!  I will never buy from them again. UNBELIEVABLE!!"

  "articleText": "Ordered a kitchen and its installation in August this year. The quality is good and the montage team is professional and friendly. At least that’s what I can say based on a half assembled kitchen.On the other hand the delivery and IKEA support are just terrible. Delivery guys will look for any excuse to deliver everything only to the ground floor (I live on the 4th floor and IKEA support assured me that the delivery will be to the flat). Kitchen should have arrived in four parts. Two times the delivery team rejected bringing the packages to the 4th floor. First time I had to bring the heavy oven myself to my floor. Second time after a quick argument the guys just drove away together with the working tops and reported that I wasn’t at home when they arrived.As for IKEA support. The chat on the website is always “too busy, no one is available at the moment”. Every time you try a phone call, you have to wait for 20-30 minutes for their response (which also might end with a hang up).The montage team promised me that in a few days IKEA will contact me and they will finish the delivery and the installation. Two weeks have already passed and nothing happened. When I tried to call IKEA support. After another 20-30 minutes of waiting they said that they don’t have support for that question in English and suggested that I try my luck and go to their store: maybe there will be a person who will be able to help me. I’m sorry but that’s definitely not a service that costs more than €1600. And that’s definitely the first and the last time I buy at IKEA something that requires delivery."

The driver then called me back to say he was unable to deliver the 2 sofas to my apartment door. I immediately called customer Services and spoke to Temilola , who was most helpful and spoke to the delivery transport department. She asked me if I would take full responsibility for any damage which might occur if they took it up to the third floor, to which I assured I would do so. She tried to contact the driver but was not able to speak to him . Eventually the driver informed my Builder that he would leave the packages outside the building and go off.I immediately went personally to the Hammersmith Branch and spoke to Tony the manager, who confirmed that all orders are door to door service.I told him that it cost me an additional £300.00 to pay for two people to carry the goods to the third floor.He said he would reimburse me if I would give him a VAT receipt from my builder. However my builder is not registered for VAT.Your delivery service has been absolutely shocking."

When I came home it was smaller, then I measured and it was about 77.5x38. Even on the receipt it is written 80x40. Still I tried to use them using extra supporters but it doesn’t look good and not strong enough. I called the customer service and made a complaint. They said what I only could do is to take them back to the store and ask for refund. I didn’t go back to the store and give it back because it would cost me time about 2-3 hours and travel cost and again getting tired to carry them back. I am not happy at all with the company’s service after selling the product."

I waited patiently for a month (!!!) because I didn't need the products urgently and I have better things to do with my time than complain to customer service.Then I got a notice that \"my order has been completed\". That was around 17 July. So I called IKEA, and the first representative I spoke with said he would look into it and get back to me. He never did. So I called again (waiting on hold for 10-15 minutes each time). The second rep said the same. Never got back to me. Then again, with a third rep. Then AGAIN, with a FOURTH rep. They STILL haven't got back to me, a month and a half after I placed my order!Meanwhile, I was beginning to need some of the products I had ordered, so I had to purchase from another site. I ordered on Wednesday 31 July and today, 2 August, the merchandise has already arrived.This is the SECOND time an IKEA order has been delayed. And most certainly, the LAST time I will ever order from IKEA."

  "articleTitle": "Just awful customer service",
  "articleText": "I am reticent to write this review, because I genuinely think IKEA has some wonderful products and their showroom is amazing, but the customer service is dire.I had an issue a few years back regarding part delivery of a sofa. I took a day off for redelivery of the missing part but it still didn’t come. I then had to take another day off, go to a showroom and wait two hours whilst someone signed it off to get the final part of the sofa, that I had bought.The reason for this review is that I bought two wardrobes around six years ago. The wardrobes are great and have lasted, but the backs of the wardrobes haven’t survived my last move unfortunately. I went onto live chat during my lunch break to see if I could BUY (not blag for free) two new backs for the wardrobes and some nails. I am offering to buy something that they will have in every warehouse up and down the country.I was asked for an all the details of my original order, which I don’t have due it being six years ago. The advisor then said my purchase fell outside the guarantee and that he could not help. I re-emphasised that I do not want these items for free, I will pay for them (and delivery. And for the damn nails, of which they will have millions lying around) but he said they don’t do that.I was then told the only solution is to buy two new wardrobes (in order to get the two backs in need for the wardrobes I already have). Honestly, no word of a lie, that is the only solution offered.I just don’t understand, ikea has a wonderful concept and great buying experience but the customer service afterwards is awful. I’ve spent £,000’s with them over the years, even after my first issue, but now I won’t. I’ve literally got a list on my table (also from ikea) of 10 things I was planning to get from them for my upcoming move.A real let down and a shame."

  "articleTitle": "Avoid IKEA for Kitchen Installation - A nightmare Experience!",
  "articleText": "I am incredibly disappointed with the kitchen purchasing and installation service I received from IKEA.The design service was great, and the staff were professional and helpful. However, that's where the positives end. The assigned kitchen installer, visited my home to inspect the site on and he didn't agree with the drawings. My kitchen was scheduled for delivery 8 weeks later, but the delivery was incomplete, and installation was delayed multiple times. I was left without a functional kitchen for five weeks – no running water, no sink, no basic kitchen facilities. It was an absolute nightmare, leaving me in a situation that no household should have to endure.Worse still, the responsibility for these delays was continually passed between IKEA and their installation team. IKEA blamed the installers, and the installers pointed the finger back at IKEA. The complete lack of coordination and accountability was frustrating, to say the least.Despite numerous calls to IKEA’s customer service, I was repeatedly given empty promises. I was assured that the issues would be resolved, but no one ever followed up. I spent weeks chasing answers on my own, and the level of customer service I experienced was far below what I would expect from a company like IKEA, especially after spending such a significant amount of money. After the installation was completed, I contacted IKEA to highlight the issues I had and once again I was completely ignored.This experience has been so negative that I would strongly advise anyone to avoid IKEA for kitchen installations. While the initial design process was great, everything that followed has been an utter disaster.IKEA needs to seriously improve its service, communication, and accountability. This ordeal has been stressful, inconvenient, and entirely unacceptable. Save yourself the frustration and look elsewhere for your kitchen needs."

  "articleText": "I bought a dresser online 7/29/24 and it was delivered damaged so I called immediately and took pictures. We are now at 9/24/24, so right at 2 months and I am still dealing with trying to be refunded for this dresser. They give you the run around by taking the same information over and over on every call and then tell you it has to be escalated to a higher tier to approve a discount. It went weeks with no response to be told that they would only offer 35%. Even though i didn’t agree because i felt the damage and my time spent dealing with them warranted more than 35% I went ahead and accepted the offer which was sent to me via email. I called to confirm I would accept the discount and again all my info was taken again and I was told it would be 3-5 days and I would see the refund…. Well that didn’t happen. I got an email on 9/4/24 saying they couldn’t reach me by the number I gave them (untrue) because it’s the number I call from and verify everytime I call them. So I Made another call today and explained the entire story again to be put on hold for 20 min so Anupoim the person helping me could ask if the refund could be put on my debit card ( that was not what he was doing, I can assure you that) he comes back and and just says OK and I say ok what? What’s happening, because he never verified the card, never said when to expect the refund, and when I asked he said “you just wait” I had to ask how he was planning on refunding my money and when.  So I’ve been told again 3-5 business days.. I have no trust in this happening because it’s been 2 months of dealing with them and over 15 calls to them and nothing has happened at this point in time. They have awful customer service and follow through. I will never order online from them again because this is the run around you get if you receive an item that’s damaged. Then if you want to return it they want you to disassemble and put back in their boxes.. that’s a joke because it’s been 2 months those boxes long gone in the trash.  Not to mention my time to disassemble the product. IKEA does not value the customer experience nor do they want to really make it right for the customer, in fact they use every tactic to try not make it right by making the process as long and complicated as possible. BEWARE IKEA IS NOT ABOUT THE CUSTOMER!!!!!!"

  "articleTitle": "IKEA needs to stop using Top Delivery Service",
  "articleText": "Awful service with getting my IKEA kitchen delivery. I used IKEA to design and process my kitchen. Planned and paid for weeks ago for the kitchen to be delivered on September 19th 2024. Top Delivery Service didn’t show up. According to the email and text messages, TDS is supposed to ring you half an hour before they arrive, they never did. According to TDS track and trace, they were 1 stop away for more than an hour. Then suddenly 3 stops away. They were already extremely late according to their own delivery window. At this point I contacted TDS and they said that the truck had an issue and they won’t be able to deliver the kitchen, and that they have contacted IKEA and that IKEA will contact me to create a new appointment. TDS made no attempt to contact me. I only found this out by me contacting them. I had to call IKEA support the next day as it was already gone 18:00. Next morning I called IKEA support, they had no idea that there was an issue with my delivery. So TDS lied about contacting IKEA. IKEA support called TDS to find out where my kitchen was, and IKEA said that my kitchen was still in the truck, because the truck had an issue recharging. (Electric vehicle). I asked IKEA to ask TDS to send another truck to get my kitchen. (I had hired contractors to help me build the kitchen, taken time off work, and have no current working kitchen because it was supposed to arrive on the 19th.) IKEA said they will call me back in 30 mins to see what solution they can get me. 4 hours later I heard nothing from IKEA so I called them again. This time IKEA contacted TDS and said the truck was in an accident. And the truck won’t get fixed till next week. And the driver is refusing to allow another truck to collect my kitchen. IKEA said I will get compensation for each day the kitchen is delayed. I got a new order delivery date which is 24th September, as TDS couldn’t deliver on Monday and they wouldn’t know if the truck would be working. I also emailed TDS asking why a delivery company doesn’t have an extra truck to collect my kitchen from the broken truck. I have had zero response. On Monday (23rd September) I call IKEA to make sure that TDS is actually delivering on Tuesday (24th September). IKEA support couldn’t tell me because they had no way of contacting TDS. So, to recap. TDS truck ran out of electricity, also had an accident, IKEA can contact TDS and IKEA cannot contact TDS. Luckily I got a track and trace message on the Monday night saying my kitchen should arrive between 12:45 and 14:45 on Tuesday the 24th of September. It is now 00:27 Wednesday 25th of September and I still have not got my kitchen, and zero communication from TDS. I do not understand why IKEA keeps using this company to deliver its kitchens. This has been an awful, stressful and expensive experience. I will not be buying from IKEA again and I certainly hope TDS never delivers anything for me again.So now Top Delivery Service has failed to delivery my kitchen twice, with zero communication. I will have to call IKEA again…"

  "articleTitle": "This has been a nightmare",
  "articleText": "This has been a nightmare!I should have known when the order was placed and 6 out of the 9 doors needed were listed as “out of stock”. The customer service agent was very positive on that call. She stated that she was sure they would be back in stock on Monday (this was a Saturday) so we could place a second order for those on Monday to accompany this order. She was absolutely correct! They were back in stock……but then we have problem #2, delivery on those doors were no longer an option as it states the “truck was full”. After speaking with MANY customer service agents, was finally transferred to one who could resolve the issue and had the 6 remaining doors Fed Ex to my home to arrive the same day as the delivery of everything else on the 18th.Fast forward to the 18th…at this point, I have received several text messages confirming and appointing a time for delivery for this day from the delivery company. Original time is between 4p-8p. Then another text stating 7p-9p. At 9:25, an email arrive stating that the distance for delivery was too far for the delivery company and my order would have to be rescheduled. I called customer service and the gentleman confirmed my order would be delivered the next morning by 9am. At 9:30, no delivery received, so I once again call customer service. I spoke with another lady who states #1 it was not rescheduled for today, #2 the next available delivery date would be the 25th, #3 the delivery address was too far for the delivery company, #4 Fed Ex was not an option for these pieces, #5 a Supervisor has to be notified by an open case and will return your call. The agents cannot forward calls to Supervisors.#1- So I was lied to the night before?#2- The issues and concerns with why it hasn’t been delivered as of yet will not exist on the 25th for a delivery?#3- IKEA sent my order to a delivery company that cannot deliver to this address, but your agent would like to reschedule with the same delivery company?#4- She further stated Fed Ex does not deliver large items which I had to call her on as I told her we have had multiple large items delivered by them which is why Fed Ex utilizes large trucks.#5- You, as a customer, are not important enough to speak with Supervisors when your issues are not being resolved by customer service. You must be “scheduled” (as I was told she had me on the schedule to be called at 1pm).Very, very poor customer services! One of the solutions offered was for me, as the customer, to drive over an hour away to “pick up” my order, which would require a trailer rental, and they would “waive the pick up fee”. However, that also has to be scheduled on their timeframe. It was very easy to accept my order stating my address was acceptable, accept my money, but cannot deliver customer service or delivery of what was promised when my order and money was accepted."

Parts of the money was paid via a gift card I was gifted. The money for the rest was back into my ban account but the gift card is basically \"burned\" and I realized through 1000 phone calls that their super inefficient \"gift card department\" needs to issue a new one, which I should receive shortly after the cancelation.But again some of their colleagues said I should email them and ask for a new one, of course I did so.So far no answer, seems like the so called department is not bothering as the money is in their bank account since many months ago and they do not see a reason to work on sth which is already paid for! Very shameful!"

  "articleText": "I recently ordered and paid for a kitchen from IKEA to arrive on a set date.  The Friday before the delivery, I received a confusing email with both confirmation of the order, and a pdf of a refund for some of the amount paid.I checked my bank the next morning and a partial sum was there. Why? I called customer service any they said that no problem, the delivery was still planned, but then after checking to confirm, said ah yes, it had been cancelled, as IKEA had taken the decision to reimburse for the kitchen as some of the items were not available any more (although they had been when I paid for them). I'd also bought a bed ( needed for during the renovation), which had been voluntarily cancelled by IKEA too. However, it seems some €160 worth of spare pieces (batons for mounting dishwasher, carbon filters, decorative mouldings) are still arriving by post on Tuesday!This is just a mess, and a major inconvenience as the cost in time and money is considerable - we had also made travel arrangements to be there on site for Tuesday.  Needless to say we are furious at the lack of service and valid explanation for this failure to fulfill a completed order.. Noone bothered to let me know,  or check if we may need some of the other items on the order (bed?) before to taking the decision to cancel the order.Neglectful, soulless big business, and very far from 'The Wonderful Everyday'. Not feeling it from IKEA. Shameful."

He didn't call or try to reach me out, I went outside to show him where to park but he just left and didn't deliver any items to me. Then I called customer support and asked if the driver can come back and deliver the items. He spoke to the driver and it wasn't possible so after that I got a booking for delivery on day which doesn't suit me at all. I was transferred to another person in customer support and after a long conversation it turned out that there was no order and none of my items in the truck at all. Although I got a tracking link and information from IKEA that my order will be delivered today from 12:30 to 15:30, and didn't get any cancellation prove. So in the end we agreed that the click and collect will be picked up. Even though we found a solution, I find it completely unprofessional from IKEA's side, from the driver's side or carriers side, and from the customer service side, as I did not receive any notification that my order will not be delivered today. The driver was at my address, but didn't call and just left.  I find  service  very unprofessional which led to lost day for me!"

  "articleText": "Ikea has messed up the delivery for a pax wardrobe several times. We were still missing the doors and Ikea kept scheduling it at the wrong days at first. When I reached out to customer service, the lady (Chloe) said that I don’t need to check-in with them, that I should trust them to do their job. I did…they then cancelled our orders just to tell us the doors are completely discontinued. So we were stuck with a half build wardrobe. Instead of getting support from customer service, we got a lot of rude, interrupting and gaslighting people on the phone that were not much understanding or helpful.My perception of IKEA has changed completely and I will from now on avoid them at all costs."

Unbelievable, and I guess it's easy to be brave making fun of someone while hiding behind a phone and a pc.

Consequently, I had no choice but to opt for home delivery, incurring an additional fee of €60.To my dismay, shortly after my order was dispatched and the delivery fee was charged, I received an automated email notification indicating that the product was now back in stock for pickup. This timing seems highly suspicious and gives the impression that the item was deliberately restocked only after my order was processed, forcing me to incur unnecessary delivery costs.I have tried to address this issue via email but have yet to receive a response from your team. This lack of communication and resolution is unacceptable and does not reflect the level of customer service I expected from IKEA."

I rang IKEA and had to hold on the line for over 30 mins before a representative spoke to me , she said that she couldn’t find my eircode and asked me for another one near my house JUST FOR REFERENCE, she ASSURED me that the items will still be delivered to MY HOUSE even though she took the other eircode for reference , she also said that they will deliver my correct items and pick up the wrong ones on TUESDAY. When Monday came around I got a notification that my items won’t be delivered till THURSDAY now . Thursday comes around they end up delivering  my items to the WRONG house to that eircode that she said is only for reference even though she assured me several times that I will still get them delivered to my house . The delivery guys not only delivered my items to wrong house but also didn’t pick up the wrong items. I had to ring them and complain for them to turn back around and come to collect the wrong items . And once they arrived I showed them the email reference with my address and told them they delivered to the wrong house , and one of the delivery drivers went on to argue with me and was very very rude even though I’m the customer who was actually wronged by their company several times . It wasn’t my fault that they label the items wrong or deliver to wrong addresses . This was my first time ordering and never again . That delivery driver should have at least apologized to me for all this inconvenience that I had to deal with for no reason but he went on to argue with me , blame me for everything even though it’s there company fault he was so rude to me slamming the doors of their van and sticking the invoice into my face trying to prove me wrong he was so busy trying to argue with me he didn’t even help the other driver with the boxes he had to carry all on his own . And now I’ve to go and pick my items up from a wrong house after I’ve also paid a €60 delivery charge !!!!"

But now, after 28 years of use,  the kitchen looks shabby. Need new doors, side panels, drawer fronts. So today we drove to IKEA, four hour round trip. We had to go there in person as IKEA no longer produce catalogues and paper documentation and the IKEA website is useless. So what did we find ? Panels, doors etc still sold but hinges won't match our old base units. Means ripping out complete kitchen and buying all new units. Makes a mockery of a huge IKEA poster near the door urging people to renovate. And as said, no leaflets with specs available. Would have helped as I still have the complete paper documents from my original order. Spent three hours there looking for replacements we could use and gave up. Will hire a local painter to sand and repaint units. Good guy, used him for thirty years. Ikea's loss, but after seeing the staff I don't think they care. It's just a job."

I requested cancellation of my order, given that I had waited 6 days for a suitable delivery date around my working hours but was expected to wait in for another delivery attempt tomorrow....eh, no thanks DPD 🙂 IKEA call advisor informed me a supervisor would not call me for such a matter as I had requested. Stated the complaint process had been followed, they had processed a full refund on my behalf.....yes, only because I requested the refund.IKEA, I will NEVER, EVER, EVER, order from your company online or visit any of your stores to purchase anything, ever again. This behaviour from your delivery agent's driver has disgusted me immensley. Yes, its Saturday. Yes, it's 7pm. But do know what IKEA & DPD, you's should ensure that all individuals taking on roles as delivery drivers for your companies are aware that they are THE true representatives of your companies. I wonder how many  of the Marek's in this world have lost companies good business and given some such a bad name. Marek surely knew that his role with DPD included Saturday working at 7pm and IKEA, you's probably chose DPD as your Agent thinking that their drivers would be honest, efficient and reliable. Not the case."

  "articleText": "I had a Bestå TV cabinet delivered. Nearly £200 is not big money for a piece of furniture but it replaced an excellent Ikea TV bench that was only £80, albeit 10 years ago.It arrived in two boxes, including one huge box, opened with the shelves and other items just tossed in. All 4 shelves had chipped corners. I only noticed 2 were chipped before contacting them for replacements unfortunately. No account or phone options so spent nearly 1 hour online waiting for someone to answer (you can return from your account but once you get through the process, right at the end you’re told to contact customer service. Terrible customer experience!)Onto the unit. It’s cheap, featherweight chipboard of the poorest quality, unbelievably soft and shows any marks - in fact it’s almost impossible not to damage when assembling with the baffling instructions (one of the problems of the modular design - the instructions come with each individual item and parts that don’t apply - and the instructions for the hinges are on the plastic packaging and barely readable.)The whole unit is so cheap and flimsy, with plastic fasteners, and cheap wood that it’s not even square. The hinges are adjustable and you will need that adjustment as it’s simply not possible to get the middle and the outer vertical edges of the doors square. It’s something I’d expect from a no name cheap discount store for £50, not from a global branded product nearly four times that price!They did send 2 new doors free of charge that were thankfully not damaged in transit - more luck than design as the packaging was again poor.The icing on the cake was deleting my review on their website. There are some negative reviews but I wouldn’t trust what’s written as there are a lot of similar glowing reviews that look suspiciously like bots.If you like reasonably priced decent quality products - shop elsewhere."

It is very frustrating and shocking to see that Ikea and its delivery partner can be so callous about their customers and their delivery issues. We had ordered all important products like bed, mattress and couch and etc for setting up a new apartment. Scheduled a delivery date. We flew in(expensive plane tickets)  from out of state so that we could be here to accept the delivery on time. also reserved the loading dock and elevator since we were given a time from 8 am to 8 pm for delivery and what happens on the scheduled day of delivery, the delivery service never gets in touch with us and when we call to find out about the estimated time frame of delivery, they tell us that there is no driver to deliver. When contacted IKea is unable to help other than reschedule the date of delivery, As if IKEA is going to pay for our flight tickets if we reschedule. Is this the kind of service that we all should be expecting from a reputed company like IKEA. They would not even let us cancel the order. The delivery service RXO that is partnered with IKEA does not have good reviews. Despite this IKEA is still partnering with them and putting their customers through distress. How is IKEA and RXO going to compensate for our wasted time, money and the emotional stress caused."

This fridge/freezer combination is made by Electrolux, and hopefully they have solved this cocktail of weaknesses in a revised version. But I hold my breath.

  "articleText": "I grew up with Ikea and was a fan. But how things are handled now is unacceptable. This company has gone down hill terribly. I was purchasing two bathroom vanities from Ikea and needed matching sinks. Before placing my order I called to make sure that the sink I chose would actually fit this particular vanity. It was confirmed to me that it would. In the middle of the remodel when every hour counts, we had to find out that both sinks were 2 inches shorter than the vanity, I called again and the lady from customer service was still insisting that it was the right sink!!!! I was losing my mind. Then she suggested that I would get a consultation with a specialist and made me an appointment for a kitchen consulation insisting that this person also does bathrooms. Of course that was wrong. When I finally had a consulation with the bathroom design agent, it was just as useless as the last. We had to figure out which sink ourselves. But then when I spoke with resolution to organize a new delivery and pick up of the wrong sink, I was promised that it would all be taken care of the next day. We were on a time line, so I thought one more day would be ok. I had it in writing, pick up of the 2 sinks that didn't fit and drop off of the two sinks that would fit. It said from 8am till 8pm. The 2 wrong sinks were picked up, guy didn't speak english. So at 8pm after waiting all day I had to call again. Then I was told that there was not going to be a delivery. Not only was I promised over the phone but i had it in writing. If they screwed up, they could have called, emailed or texted. Nothing!!!I am furious!! Every single step that Ikea assisted me with was horrible. Every single employee that I spoke with was incapable. This will be the down fall of a once great company. Sad, so sad..."

  "articleText": "I am deeply disappointed with my recent experience with IKEA. Despite having paid for a Saturday delivery, my product was not delivered as promised. This caused significant inconvenience as I had arranged for someone to help me install a wardrobe over the weekend.The delivery was rescheduled to Sunday without any prior consultation. However, to my dismay, it was once again postponed to another day. This lack of reliability and disregard for the customer’s time is unacceptable.Furthermore, I found IKEA’s customer service to be extremely unsatisfactory. It appears that there is a lack of concern for the customers and their needs. This experience has left me with a negative impression of IKEA as a company.I strongly advise potential customers to consider these issues before deciding to purchase from IKEA."

Got an email day before saying it’d be between 7am & 11am. Called again and explain why it had to be pm but it absolutely had to be delivered on 5th as rearranged builder that construct. Was promised delivery on 5/6. Called on 5/6 to check it’d all be ok as had no faith whatsoever. Was absolutely promised delivery by 11.30am. And guess what it never came!! Builder now not available for weeks, massively out of pocket and still no goods. Would never place a big order again. How can a company this big be unable to deliver!

The assistant told us that there was a 10 year guarantee on everything. Two and a half years later, the topper was not useable any longer. It was lumpy, flat and painful to lay on. I contacted Ikea and was told that the top mattress only had a two year guarantee so there was nothing they could do to help. The topper was one of the most expensive ones in the store so we expected more than two years use. I was not happy with the online chat so called the customer service dept. The lady on the phone was very rude and unhelpful. We were lied to and had to buy a new topper. Needless to say, we didn't buy it at Ikea. The customer service used to be good. When did Ikea stop caring ?"

All the agents are very helpful, but it’s the behind the scenes part that appears to not know what’s happening. We have been offered some sort of goodwill gesture, which is good, but it really is a poor reflection on IKEA, that this level of disorganisation exists in IKEA. Today is the 7th June, and still we have no delivery. I have spent more time than I care to think chasing this order. IKEA are simply useless, and to be avoided at all costs. One star is being generous. I also requested a call back from a supervisor and to date still awaiting that. You can see the level of dissatisfaction in the reviews, so use your feet, and take your business elsewhere. The cheaper option often ends up being the dear one."

Ikea sent their not very impartial sofa agent to inspect, who found sofa to be faulty. Ikea acknowledged faults/failings. But it has taken them almost two years now and still there is no replacement sofa, the price of the sofa has gone up from 669.00 in 2021 to 930.00 now. So for almost two years they have provided regular excuses on sofa unavailable, or out of stock or something similar. Now they are threatening me with closing my case - Enrika has decided, unilaterally, like some fascist state that Ikea  can decided when they have had enough of customers who have been failed by Ikea. Work that out. Dreadful service, products and experience. I note from other online reviews  that Ikea has been providing awful service and care to thousands of others."

I have only ever had office chairs in the past, which I can tilt back and relax in, but this horrible chair keeps thrusting me forward and I feel completely deceived and misled by the advert. I will not be shopping with IKEA again but I will return to my beloved and trustworthy Wayfair, who have far more honest advertising and friendly staff.

  "articleTitle": "Worst customer service in Poland",
  "articleText": "I bought 3 Pax wardrobes (including transport and assembly) online, the order was carried out by the Warsaw Janki store. One of the wardrobes was damaged, but the complaint was quickly resolved. IKEA employees came to assemble it.Part of the assembly process involves attaching the wardrobe to the wall with dowels. The gentleman took a large drill with a large drill bit and smashed it into the wall, drilling through the wall to such an extent that a piece of several centimeters flew a distance of a meter in the next room. The pieces fell onto the office chair and, as it turned out, scratched the leather-like material. When I realized this, I informed the employee about the fact, who calmly replied \"happens\" and continued working. After a while, he said it was my fault, because I should have informed him that the wall was thin, because he thought it was wall between apartments. I will add that  he could easily enter the next room, and there is no door yet, so he could measure the wall withaout any issue.In the end, he behaved no better - he stood with his back to me and said 'I'm sorry for damaging the wall'. He wrote in the report that the wall was damaged, but the chair was not. I don't know on what basis they stated this. When they left, the chair was covered in shrapnel. I refused to sign the protocol with the content they proposed.Of course, I filed a complaint about the service, expecting the wall to be repaired and monetary compensation for the damage to the chair. Ikea wrote back to me that they were sorry about the situation, but they were unable to help me because, quoting Ikea's letter, \"IKEA does not provide renovation and construction services\" and \"The verification of the case and the entry in the protocol after installation showed that the swivel chair was not damaged. Only a wall.\" Of course, they are very sorry \"Please accept our apologies for any inconvenience you have experienced.\". My first and last purchases at IKEA. I decorated the entire apartment, bought furniture from various companies, but I am still shocked at behaviour of Ikea. Shame on you."

  "articleTitle": "my experience with IKEA has been an  ONGOING NIGHTMARE SINCE APRIL!!!",
  "articleText": "My experience with IKEA has been an absolute nightmare since April 18 2024, It is now May 23 2024!!!!We purchased two nightstands & had Taskrabbit come to put them together. One of the nightstands was defective so IT COULD NOT EVER BE PUT TOGETHER!!!  . Although IKEA replaced it, THEY WILL NOT REFUND THE MONEY THAT WE PAID TO TASKRABBIT IN ADVANCE TO PUT THE NIGHTSTAND TOGETHER, BUT NEVER GOT PUT TOGETHER. Instead they  offered a gift card which we immediately declined… THEY SENT IT ANYWAY!!! … we told them day one we wanted The money refunded to our credit card since it’s IKEA fault the item could not be put together .NOTE: The refund we requested is only a $36 refund to our credit card. They refused not once but 7  different times with  7 different reps (one  woman getting nasty telling us we got a gift card what more do we want??) She couldn’t Understand my point was THAT I DID NOT WANT THE GIFT CARD… ????So we drove 40 miles to the store, & spoke to a SO-CALLED Supervisor named WENDY & after 40 minutes she told us she was changing the gift card over to a refund   on our credit card,  we just had to wait  2 wks  for it to go thru. We requested a copy in writing of this, but She said there was nothing she could give us & we just had to be patient. We left the store knowing deep down in our gut we would be back! ! Well we waited the 2 weeks & as we suspected we  received nothing again! so I called Corperate & Corperate informed me that No one in the store , Including Wendy the supervisor ,has the ability to give $$$ back on a credit card? !!! The only thing that they are at liberty to do is give out a gift card , PERIOD!!!! So back again, we drove 40 miles to IKEA this time to speak with an on duty manager named Jesse, who said he’d be off the next day but would PERSONALLY see to  it that something got done &  that we’d get a  call. He took our personal info &  phone number & said he would follow up &   himself. ,&  AGAIN WE GOT NOTHING!!!So to wrap up …EVERY SINGLE PERSON WE HAVE DEALT WITH EITHER ON THE PHONE (telling me a supervisor would call me back & then didn’t) & IN PERSON  HAS BLATANTLY LIED!!! Both Representatives  &  supervisors . To me that says the company itself is telling them to do this!!! How can it be every single employee  is the same way???? This  must  be policy… “ LIE TO THE CUSTOMER AGAIN & AGAIN, THEY WILL GET TIRED & FRUSTRATED, & THEY WILL GO AWAY!!!”ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIC, UNPROFESSIONAL OUTRAGEOUS. DISGUSTING BEHAVIOR.!!!So sad! This company clearly  has no honor , no character & no self value that they think nothing of lying to your face like they do!I would NEVER recommend this company to anyone due to this & I would NEVER recommend their products to anyone since they don’t feel they have any responsibility in returning your money when their sub-par products cannot be put together! They obviously think people have plenty of time on their hands to sit around  & wait for somebody to TRY TO put something together FOR HOURS, THEN HAVE TO WAIT FOR A NEW ITEM TO BE DELIVERED, THEN HAVE TO WAIT AGAIN FOR THE SAME PRODUCT THEY GOT THE FIRST TIME TO BE PUT TOGETHER ALL OVER AGAIN, & HAVE TO PAY FOR IT NOT ONCE BUT 2X   AS WELL!!!I am seriously considering small claims court if this review does not end with a $36 refund on our credit card!. And if I do, I will be filing for not just the  the $36 Lost to taskrabbit, but also The return of both night tables .($357) I still have in my possession & THAT I WILL GLADLY RETURN . court fees,($30,) the 3 hrs  of time  I spent back-n-forth to IKEA ($225) ), plus  whatever amount of hours I’m not working & sitting in a courtroom because of this. I get paid $75 an hour , so  if court takes 3hrs wait time, IKEA would possibly be looking at a minimum bill of  $836 bill when all they had to do is put  $36 back to my fathers card!!! Does this make sense to anyone? ,ANYONE??, BUELLER ??? BUELLER????#UTTERLYRIDICULOUS"

  "articleText": "Ikea BurbankMember number 6275980387768338193,3 years ago I bought what was supposed to be high quality kitchen units with 25 year warranty, now the base corner unit double door hinge was ripped from the side wall attachment due to the base unit is made from chip wood which is not strong enough to withstand the weight of the double door.complaints to customer service lasted several weeks as they kept asking over and over again for photos of the damage although they sent every time.Eventually they send me a replacement base corner unit which is no good to me as I have to get the counter top and most of the kitchen units removed to replace the base corner unit. It needs a repair scheme  but they said they do not do repairs although they have subcontractors who could easily do the job.I had to pay $150 to get it repaired. The kitchen unit cabinets are of inferior quality and not worth the money. You can get cabinets made from plywood which are less than half the price and much stronger.The 25 year warranty is not worth the paper it is written on. I would never buy any furniture from Ikea again. Just to note that the price of the units now are 50% more than what I paid then!Mike Mossess"

  "articleText": "IKEA BLETCHLEY, zero stars if i could, used the Bletchley store to design PAX wardrobes in the master bedroom in a recently purchased property. the property had just been recently renovated.the final design was ordered and paid for and a week to be delivered. loads and loads of boxes arrived and TaskRabbit were booked to erect and install the wardrobes at a cost of £420! on the day of the install i dismantled the bed and some units and moved them into the en-suite so that they had enough space to erect the 2 corner Wardrobes and chest of drawers. 5 hours later and all was complete and fixed into position by screwing into the external blockwork.i check through the install and all looked good and worked as expected, it was a nice snug fit so the measuring had been done correctly...Once the installer had left i proceeded to re-erect the bed and slid that into position between the two wardrobes.. this is were it all starts going wrong!!with the bed in position the wardrobe doors will not open! with the corner wardrobe you have to fully open door no1 by at least 110 degrees to be able to open the door no2, but as the bed was next to the wardrobe you could only open door no1 by 90degrees which didnt allow enough room to be able to open door no2, so now the wardrobe is effectively useless as i cant even open the doors.Back to IKEA design department to see what they can do! and after scratching his head for 10 minutes the only solution was to apologise and tell me to go to the customer care dept and request a refund.so feeling a bit p!55ed at this, off i went to the CCD and told them of my problem. this was not an issue and a full refund was going to be given as soon as the wardrobes were dismantled they will be collected,  i asked who can dismantle them? they replied that it would be my responsibility to arrange this as it was my decision to return the wardrobes! i checked with Taskrabbit and they quoted £350 to dismantle them which IKEA had confirmed they would not refund me even though it was their mess up by designing  wardrobes that would clearly not work.after refusing the dismantling cost i dismantled them myself and the wardrobes have been collected.once the wardrobes had been removed the damage caused to my newly decorated bedroom is horrendous with holes in the wallpaper where the units had been screwed to the wall and 6mtr sections of coving removed as the wardrobes were full height.i emailed ikea requesting help to repair the damage cause by their mess up and all they said was i am lucky to be getting a refund! they also refused to help with the install costs of £420 which i paid out needlessly for.if their designers had been given the correct training these errors would not happen and i wouldn't be out of pocket by £420 with also £1000 worth of damage that requires repairing due to no fault of my own.they are a truly awful company and i will never shop at this place again.."

I waited at the ground floor and saw the truck coming, waiting 1 min, then suddenly going away. I received a message stating \"the parcel could not be delivered\"! I had to spend so much time on the phone with IKEA hotline, to re-schedule, etc. Such a waste of time/energy/money...!No improvement has been achieved by their service for the last 2 years which is surprising.Even though I was born in Sweden, I cannot stay silent.Either you deliver PROPERLY 3 weeks after having ordered OR YOU JUST DON'T DELIVER.Boiling regards."

But when it comes to delivery and the customer service, it's absolutely shocking! 😳I made an order of around £450 and paid the £35 express delivery since I wasn't avaliable any other day.The next day comes, I wait for my IKEA delivery, and around 7pm I was told it was coming the next day.Devistated and a waste of one of 52 free days a year.So I called to have it cancelled.First they accused me of already getting the item and had to guide them to the message THEY had sent. 💀They didn't want to cancel it it and just wanted to send me a £15 voucher.That's no good if I'm not in, especially with all the rain.So after a bit of an argument about how I should be able to cancel and it being a waste of my day now along side being argued with, it got cancelled and he was sending a voucher.Thursday comes, still no voucher, I was waiting to get it before placing another order.I called and someone said they'll fast track I and I should be with me in 24 hours, if not call again.It's now Sunday, I call up and before saying anything was \"Hello Sir\"?This already got my back up a little bit as it's not the usual way someone from a call centre would respond.He couldnt find any logs of my order being canceled, who, canceled is and the voucher.The only thing he could see was whoever fast tracked it on Thursday.He denied any acknowledgement of last Saturday and kept saying I need to wait 7 days from the day I called which was Thursday. \"NO IT WAS SATURDAY\".He kept telling me I've not called before then. I said I wanted to make a complaint and he said I can't until after 7 days.At this point I got mad. It's been 8 days! 😡 I said.I said there seems to be alot of messing with cancellations and vouchers that aren't on the books and you seem to to be in on it.I then calmly said do you work for or represent IKEA... Silence.I asked the same question again.He said yes quietly...I said so do you work for IKEA?He hung up.So my conclusion is an internal scandal and I'm convinced the silence either meant, yes he does work for IKEA and doesn't want to be found out.Or he doesn't directly work for IKEA, or shouldn't be and is nervous about being found out."

  "articleText": "I ordered a worktop, a divider screen, and a few other items from IKEA to redecorate my office.The box for the worktop arrived with dirty footprints and a small hole on it. The box for the SCREEN also had footprints(!!!!) and several large holes in the cardboard.Predictably, the worktop had a gouge in it, and the plastic panels on the screen were warped out of their frames and have permanent stress marks on them from being walked on, so one side of the screen is essentially ruined.As for the couriers, All-star logistics, they forgot to bring in one of the items I had ordered, a MALM chest of drawers, so I had to phone them and have them come back. To their credit, they were apologetic and returned within 20 minutes, but it still shouldn't have happened, and speaks to the overall professionalism of the couriers that IKEA is working with in Ireland.I ordered a few smaller items too (a wastepaper basket, some table legs, etc), and they weren't packed at all in the truck, they were just loose. The wastepaper basket arrived with minor scuffs along the top edges.And would you believe it, one of the smaller items I ordered was missing (a bracket for a shelf)! I can't imagine how that happened! The courier told me that it was missing upon arrival, and said that he had put in an order for a replacement that would be delivered by DPD in 10 days. (What good is that going to do me?)IKEA only seem to offer full returns or exchanges instead of an as-is discount, which is a huge bloody nightmare considering I've just spent the day hauling a 60lbs worktop around corners and up a spiral staircase before noticing the damage and need to get things done on a schedule.Also, do not believe the product photos on IKEA's website for worktops. For the Ekbacken worktop, the website shows a shiny surface with the edges of the laminate well finished, but the thing in person is a textured surface with ugly thin black lines around the seams of the laminate. I'm going to have to vinyl wrap it to make it look decent. Might as well have just bought bloody particleboard and done it myself from scratch at this point.Thanks for nothing IKEA. Never again.Also, IKEA's wonderful delivery service costs €60."

  "articleTitle": "The drivers refused to deliver our…",
  "articleText": "Regarding Kitchen Cabinet Delivery:  Our experience with the planning service and with IKEA in general has been excellent.  Peak Delivery Inc. was tasked with the delivery. Upon arriving, the drivers refused to deliver our kitchen cabinets to the room we had cleared for them. It was a straight, open pathway from the truck to the cleared out space. The drivers insisted that they wanted to leave the goods in the garage, where they might be susceptible to water damage. They were going to drive away with our cabinets still in the truck, until we agreed that they could leave the goods in the garage. They said they were physically incapable of taking the boxes to the agreed upon spot. So, my husband and I started doing the heavy lifting and moved the boxes from the garage as they were placed down, to the designated room. When we asked the Peak Delivery Inc. drivers how elderly customers fare with this type of service, or how they deliver to people living in apartments, they told us that IKEA does not deliver to apartments. This was a case of complete laziness. Instead of a nice tip, they have dissatisfied customers.  Well, at least we got our steps in."

  "articleText": "IKEA what a disappointment!So me and and my little sister went through to our eldest sisters  to help our eldest sister and her partner move house and help build furniture etc.They ordered their sofa, bed and wardrobe sets etc from IKEA, spent a lot of money for them and paid extra for express delivery to be delivered next day which was meant to come Friday, to their disappointment it hadn’t shown up. So my eldest sister got on chats and calls to IKEA being told numerous different tales off of different advisors, one of the advisors which said it would be delivered Saturday between 10-2, also being told it is waiting to be dispatched. We was also told a few times Saturday morning that they would be delivered still, till we finally got through to someone again yesterday at 3/4 o’clock arguing toss with them, for him to keep sighing down the phone at us, and at this point we was farley calm with him, for him to say it will not be coming and their is nothing they can do.So we proceeded to ask for a manager or someone a little higher up to be told numerous times he couldn’t do that, which we all know they can. We finally got put through to a team leader, as we had nothing to sleep on and one of reasons I went through was to help them build, we ended up having to get Ubers and pay out for air beds which we shouldn’t of had to do.Then the team leader we spoke with admitted to us that the advisors on Friday and the ones Saturday morning should have known already that it wouldn’t be coming this weekend at all, so they lied to us multiple times. If they would have told them Friday they could have held off the rubbish removals and movers so they had something to sleep on.All in all be cautious what you’re doing when ordering big items etc from IKEA because they don’t seem to give a damn and their customer advisors are absolutely useless and need more training.And as of today, they are not delivering tomorrow either what a disgrace."

  "articleText": "Definitely not a company that I would want to buy furniture from moving forward. We went for the pax wardrobe solution with mirror doors and do not realise that the whole wardrobe had to be anchored to the wall in order to be stable. By this I mean that the wardrobe doesn't collapse when you open the doors which is exactly what happened to us. We had to get a local specialist to come and modify the wall behind the wardrobe as this was plasterboard and ensure that the wall can take the 200 kg of load without coming down as well. Ikea did not provide any guidance or any support following our complaint.I was under the impression that if a product requires a specific technical assembly or follow-up work that you would at least be notified so that you avoid buying that product if you're not able to anchor it in the right way. It would have helped to have a notification on the website saying that this wardrobe is not stable without complete anchoring in multiple points. It would have enabled me to select a different product or company all together."

I was planning to spend +$2k in other furniture for a beach apartment, but now I’m glad I didn’t! The Customer Service supervisor, Neisha, is the most disrespectful sales person I’ve met, and let me tell you… I’ve met more than a couple of incompetent self absorbed store clerks. But this person is atop, and comes with an attitude. She even declined to provide her supervisor’s name: in fact, she identified herself as the General Manager of the store. A person so blunt and lacking of basic manners and education skills… Unbelievable! After leaving the store, I called IKEA’s Customer Service, and an agent by the name of Brian not only told me that he didn’t have a supervisor either, but declined to provide a physical or email address to write a complaint. I’m still asking myself if he is, indeed, an Earthlink. Afterwards, I googled and learned that IKEA not only has one of the worst customer service ratings, but that the quality of their products is subpar and are also known for unethical and illegal practices around the world. So, hey IKEA, thank Neisha for saving me a couple of thousand $ by not spending them in the stones and sticks you sell. Still, I will be filing a formal complaint in the local Consumer Affairs Department. (I tried to not leave a One Star review, but did not find a Negative-Cero-NoGood option.)"

  "articleTitle": "Threatening Clients - the new experience from Ikea",
  "articleText": "Purchased something from Ikea (DE) and received what were clearly used items on the first part of the delivery and a bunch of broken / damaged items on the second part. Also delivery was made in a haphazard manner and they provided the wrong delivery date, so I ended up having to pick up a number of heavy pieces and lugging them up the stairs despite paying already a hefty delivery fee.Customer support was useless, so I tried to reason with them via PayPal - I even returned the broken pieces to a store and accepted to keep the used After that they committed to a partial refund, which never happened despite many reminders, calls, emails and follow ups for over a month.As I was I was still not receiving the agreed reimbursement, I then escalated the situation to PayPal who considering the situation issued a full refund within a few days - indicating that they had assessed the situation and decided in my favour due to the default of Ikea.Guess what happened?! On the same day the same Swedish store that had said nothing over a month, immediately issued a letter indicating that a payment was overdue from my side; I replied and said that while potentially  open to that, such should be discussed with PayPal who resolved the dispute and also highlighting that I had lost many hours following up on this matter. I have not received any reply to my email and now I receive a reminder threatening with a debt collection agency?!What the actual hell is wrong with you people?! You don’t reply to anything, don’t perform the refund you promised, and then threaten your customer with a debt agency? What kind of a clown show are you running?!"

  "articleTitle": "BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE MANAGER",
  "articleText": "I recently had the most disheartening and frustrating experience at IKEA Warrington, one that starkly highlights a grave lapse in the quality of customer service that one would expect from a brand of such repute. I approached the customer service desk with a simple request for a refund, an issue that should have been resolved swiftly and with minimal fuss. Instead, what I encountered was a staff that not only lacked the basic tenets of customer service but also exhibited an arrogance and dismissiveness that escalated a simple matter into an unnecessary confrontation.It is utterly appalling that in a customer-facing role, the staff at IKEA Warrington would choose to be not just unhelpful but outright abusive towards customers. Their behavior was not only unprofessional but also indicative of a disturbing lack of empathy and understanding. To be met with such arrogance and to have a straightforward issue turn into an argument speaks volumes of the dire need for a significant overhaul in their customer service training and attitude.I am deeply disappointed and shocked at the level of disdain shown towards customers. This experience has not only soured my view of IKEA Warrington but has also made me question the values and customer service ethos that IKEA purports to uphold. It is imperative that this matter be addressed with the utmost seriousness and that significant measures are taken to ensure that no other customer has to endure such an appalling experience. The staff in question should be held accountable, and a thorough review of customer service practices at IKEA Warrington is urgently needed to prevent such incidents in the future."

We are disappointed by this as we booked time for work and arranged childcare so that we would receive the sofa and have it set up at home. The customer service staff seemed indifferent to our concerns and only when we asked why we couldn’t get the 10% discount with the exchange (it was the choice of one or the other) they said they would provide a £20 voucher by way of apology. However, they said delivery of the new sofa wouldn’t be until next Sunday, and they said collection of the damaged one would be before 7pm, but we made plans to go out and we have to collect our daughter from nursery, so they probably won’t wait if they arrive while we are out. And given how tight and small the packaging was, we had no assurance the new delivery would avoid this problem of the packaging splitting open again. We also cleared the space in our home for this sofa and have nowhere to sit in our lounge until delivery next Sunday. This is such a let down by IKEA."

  "articleTitle": "Ikea does not respect promise/duty to replace goods delivered damaged",
  "articleText": "Horrible experience and not expected from Ikea. When there are no problems, you get cheap, mass-produced products which may do you fine. When you get delivered a damaged item, there is NO RESPECT FOR DECENCY, they promise to replace the damaged (paid for) item but do not do so. I ordered two pieces of furniture Feb 15 which were delivered Feb 20, one fine, the other obviously fallen off a lorry or dropped in transit, corner of packaging squashed and torn. Just looking at the corner I could see it was broken so opened a little more. Immediately submitted request for replacement and pick up of damaged goods. Was surprised they didn't even ask for photos but said they would exchange on Feb 28. I  asked for earlier but no, this was the date, they said. Feb 27 I had not had a confirmation of a window smaller than 7-19, so I contacted customer service. They said no, it would not be delivered on 28, as the goods were not in the UK yet; delivery required another week, and would be on March 6.  By now deeply suspicious, I called on March 5 to request confirmation delivery really would take place the following day but no, they \"couldn't see any record\" of the order, so issued a new one (but what about the complaint and request for replacement from the original order? What about the new order number given for the supposed Feb 28 delivery??)I have no reason to believe that the latest \"new order\" (funny ha ha, when I have been waiting since Feb 15 for this article!!)will be fulfilled any more than those of others who  have written of similar experiences. So I wondered whether they have a supply chain issue, or are about to stop making the very widely sold ALEX series..... but no, if I order the article tonight and pay for it, I can get express delivery on March 9 or normal delivery on March 11.  HOW COME IKEA CANNOT REPLACE A FULLY PAID DAMAGED ARTICLE IN LESS THAN A MONTH, BUT WILL SUPPLY A NEW ONE IF PAID AGAIN IN 1-3 DAYS???  THIS IS NOTHING BUT DELIBERATE KEEPING OF MONEY WITHOUT DELIVERING GOODS. I will complain to consumer organizations and also see if my bank can reverse the card payment made.  I am disgusted to discover that it is not mere inefficiency, or the accident that can happen to deliveries, but a deliberate choice to save money by not providing service."

He spoke perfect English to us and sent us to Customer Service, where we saw another man who also spoke English well and took no time at all to give us a new  receipt and a new voucher. We collected the drawers quickly and spent the voucher on a wooden garden table, which we did not have to pay Iva on.

The desk top wasn't even delivered to the courier. So I tried to call about it, and IKEA told me to reschedule the delivery for ONE WEEK LATER.That was such a leak of consideration with me as a client.

I'm an extremely patient person with customer service having experience on an IT helpdesk phone system, but quickly found their customer service is challenging to work with.  I got transferred three times only to wait on hold for 2 hours.  Reached the original person who transferred me improperly and was patient only asking for a manager, but was rejected.

Finally and thankfully my appointment got taken over by Jane the manager and I put my order through and was sorted. Overall not happy with the poor service and knowledge of some of the IKEA designers as it’s very hard to communicate with some of them.  Natalia Kokun even said me “one of the original designer Jose Martinez Gonzalez that design my kitchen from scratch is not necessarily right with his plan” as I found that very unprofessional to say something like that about her colleague. But Jose was best and super good at planning my kitchen. Unfortunately Jose was no longer available and not working for ikea so had to go through all these unprofessional women."

  "articleText": "Ok. This is my experience. I went into the IKEA store at Logan to build a cabinet on the computer. This was done ok, but I wanted it delivered and built. They didn't have have all the parts and told me to buy a couple to take home and avoid delay. So I did. Just two, that's ok. The items were delivered at the right date besides two pieces that were incorrect. After the builder (who was amazing) built it, they said two drawer cover parts were too small. So, I sat online (for ages) waiting for someone to talk to about it. After a lengthy process, they agreed to exchange the two pieces via delivery. But this wasnt before asking if I'd prefer to just go in and exchange them. Well, no, because it's 40 minutes away and I paid for delivery. Just deliver the right parts. So, the order was created and they had the nerve to say, you won't need to pay for these since it was our fault, consider it gesture of goodwil. Like excuse me? When they issued me the order after I stopped the chat, I read it and it was incorrect. They were issuing a replacement for exact same parts. Fml. So, I went back onto the chat and did the same process. They then did it correctly. The drivery wasn't coming for a week, but that day came and no one showed up. So, again, I went through the lengthy chat process only to be told they didn't pick it up. Well fk me right. So, I did the online chat again! They issued another order for another week later. I was travelling in the area and thought, maybe should just drop in (the day before delivery) to save the hassle and get them myself, and cancel the delivery. No, they could that, it was too hard. Wow, what a great system. They did say, but if they don't deliver them again, you can come in. Oh yes please! Not now while it's convenient for everyone, after the fact. So, true to their word, the delivery came. I opened it up, and you wouldn't believe it. They gave me the wrong colour. The wrong fkn colour. You can only guess what I need to do now. There is definitely some special people and systems at IKEA."

I ordered the mattress and set a date for its delivery. The day before the delivery was scheduled I received a call confirming and giving me a delivery window for the next day. Three hours later that day, I received an email message that my request for a refund had been processed??????? WT?

But the Authority asks me for proof of the voucher promise. I returned to Ikea Romania and asked for recorder phone calls and I was refused.All the time when I returned with the phones in the call center I was lied to in the same way: the voucher does not exist but you will receive it in a day or two, at the latest.

  "articleTitle": "No more sofas from Ikea",
  "articleText": "Very bad experience with Ikea service and product.We got a Kivik sofa 6 years ago and Ikea stated a 10 year warranty on its sofa. It specifically stated that cuscions/pillows and frames are included in the warranty. False.Sofa and pillows caved in. And we were getting back pain. We brought the sofa back to the store as it was of no use to us at that state.At Ikea store they refused us the warranty stating that these kinds of defects are specifically excluded from warranty by some internal document that was absolutely impossible to show to us. So we repeatedly asked to give us the proof of that statement in written form. The person who was at customer service desk and than his “manager” refused to show it. Therefore promised 10 year warranty appeared to have no real value.We called Ikea support. Yet we heard the same answer. We can not provide you with the written proof of misterious exception from the warranty.We consulted the site of Ikea. Product is positioned as a good quality and long lasting with good resistance to normal use, citation “Door de stevige pocketvering behoudt de bank zijn vorm en blijft hij comfortabel, jaar in jaar uit.”Kivic sofa did not keep the shape and it was not comfortable as stated. In another document Ikea states“…..What is covered under this limited warranty?This limited warranty applies to domestic use only and covers defects in material and workmanship in the following components: • frames• seat and back cushionsin the following products:…• KIVIK seating series…” closing citation.And than one little add up “IKEA will examine the product and decide, at its sole discretion, if it is covered under this limited warranty….”.So seemingly Ikea stated that it sells a nice quality product and it is ready to increase a normal 2 year warranty up to 10 years for how good it is and yet it will decide if it actually does that at its convinience.So you buy it on misleading information and get into a deal you maybe otherwise would not ever conclude. You loose your money and you do not have a usable product. We have spent thousands of euro in Ikea products and closed eyes on minor things. But this one is gross.We started checking online and apparently we were not the only ones to have an issue with the same product.So my question is : Is it a willingly omitted information to induce consumer to buy something he otherwise would not buy? If this defect is known to this product then why isn’t it specifically stated to beware of this issue. Why is refusal of warranty based on some kind of secret internal document?The sofa is rather expensive, is it just a hunt for a profit and promotion of sales on base of deceipt? We would not buy the sofa if we would know that it has such quality issues and such post-sales support.We were the only users of sofa. We have the original bill. The defects that we discovered are clearly  and expressively covered for the type of defect and the product itself. And yet we can not get to any solution.I guess a common action with this regard would be the best thing to do with other people who had the same issue.Ps. Chatting with client support was also not specifically useful. First person just like with call dropped from chat. Second one gave us an email which we used to send a complaint. That will 99.9999% end up with no real reply or solution."

The agents were very combative and said it was \"nothing to do with IKEA\" that the drop off point refused to take my parcel despite it being on Ikea's website! I called 3 different agents but none of them even tried to give any customer friendly solutions - anyone would think I was asking them to pay for the collection themselves, they were so defensive & combative.

  "articleText": "There was a time I actually thought that these guys were japanese. Because of the word being similar to Ikigai and how simplistic and minimalist some of their design of furniture is.But turns out its actually not the case.Anyways, it is still than just a company or a furniture store. They have been quite successful at creating a story and philosophy around the brand. At least that's how I see it from the outside.Anyways, just to mention a few things regarding the brand itself, their billy bookcases and malm bed frames are quite nice, i might say. The assembly process was a bit of a challenging puzzle. But frankly tho, there is a weird kind of satisfaction that comes with it after you put it all together, kinda like an adult lego you know. And you get to feel pride and the satisfaction of being a handy man.The quality of the products is pretty decent for that price. And the minimalist style works well for me.Last thing I wanna say is obviously their swedish meatballs. they are alone worth a trip to ikea every now and then."

  "articleTitle": "IKEA Cancelled their 5% in-store discount. Major downgrade and deems the membership close to pointless.",
  "articleText": "I cant believe companies continue to shrink customer benefits especially towards loyal customers then spin it like it’s supposed to make us happy. IKEA recently cancelled their 5% off family rewards discount in-store on purchases. They made it seem like they were giving people some crazy discount; in the grand scheme of business, it means nothing to IKEA but now lower income people like myself no longer have small savings. Plus it renders the entire card useless because I don’t use it for any reason besides the discount. Now I have another plastic card stashed in the landfill amongst millions of others. Their online website has poor delivery and inventory updates so visiting in-store was the way to go. I don’t even know if I want to waste my time anymore and I’ve shopped and had IKEA furniture for almost 3 decades.Also, read my previous frustrating review of using IKEA's website. Years ago, back in college, I wrote a long research paper with my full support of IKEA and why people should consider supporting IKEA. Now, I don't feel that way anymore."

Reviewed by an advisor who said due to excessive wear and tear and not oiled. Worktop just over 3 months old.Excessive wear and tear is simply a ridiculous suggestion. Worktops need sanding down and oiling - after such a short about of time is totally unacceptable. Oil needed not available to buy anyway.Customer services appalling, bordering on rude.

  "articleTitle": "Frustrating Experience with IKEA PAX System and Bestä Cabinet Delivery",
  "articleText": "I recently ordered the PAX system and Bestä cabinet from IKEA, with a total cost of around 7000€. The delivery process turned out to be a significant disappointment, leaving me with a mix of frustration and inconvenience.The delivery was divided into 5 shipments, and immediately, issues arose. One of the deliveries has been stuck for a month due to a problem in the IKEA system. This forced me to contact customer service and request a refund, adding an unnecessary hassle to the overall experience.Another delivery contained only a single glass door, which arrived with a noticeable crack in the corner. While this was certainly inconvenient, it paled in comparison to the most disappointing delivery of all. This particular shipment included a whopping 70 items. The delivery team worked so swiftly that I couldn't count the packages in real-time. However, upon closer inspection the next days, it became apparent that six crucial packages, including core components for the PAX and Bestä, were missing, along side few grffs while they were mentioned in the delivery note of that shipments.This forced me to reorder the missing items to complete the assembly process, causing delays and added expenses. The situation highlighted the need for customers to meticulously verify every piece of their delivery, as missing components can lead to significant setbacks. This task becomes even more daunting when considering the delivery cost, which was already a substantial 370€.In conclusion, It's advisable for future customers to be prepared to thoroughly inspect each delivery and, if possible, explore alternative delivery options to mitigate potential issues."

Additionally, one of the living room shelves was chipped. That evening, I contacted IKEA customer services via telephone and faced three disconnections after expressing my concerns.When I finally reached an advisor, a complaint was raised for the chipped shelf, and I was directed to return to the store and speak with a manager about the bedroom wardrobe error. The next day, I visited the store, and while the manager was amicable, the proposed solution involved collecting excess furniture, providing missing hinges and assembly of one door outstanding, and replacing the chipped shelf. There was no mention of compensation or the replacement of the wardrobes with the originally planned design. I am now left with a wardrobe unit that deviates significantly from my intended design, offering less storage space than desired. This experience has left me thoroughly disappointed with IKEA's customer care, particularly as a loyal and high-spending customer."

I registered them online. Estimate number: 596182. Approx $40My friend & I carried one each as quite heavy. I got to the desk. They got him to come out & see the bar stools. No communication,  or eye contact. just a grunt, \"Its rusty\" as he walked back out the store room. I looked at the sales assistant in disbelief. I said, they are not rusty!! It is a matte chrome! She said what he says goes. I asked could we leave them there on a trolley till we did our shopping. so much for having good quality second hand products & to be offered nothing! Please do not do Buy Back schemes if it is a farce! There were no scratches & used in very good condition. All good as a day later I had a buyer so excited to get them !I did have fun enjoying the innovative ideas in the prop rooms. A shame at how many products weren't` available. However I did find plenty of other things. one of my favourite was the very sturdy JONAXEL storage basket shelving.fitted perfectly in my wardrobe. My friend had also brought one for her craft items. The staff on the floor were very helpful including the checkout team members."

The plastic is dented and broken, it was hidden by a sticker. I would give this company -5 stars if I could. Avoid!"

We called customer service, who told us to opt for an \"express\" delivery to be delivered the next day, which cost us an additional 10€. The customer service agent said that we would be refunded and receive a commercial gesture once the order was received. The order was supposed to arrive on January 10, 2024, between 10 AM and 2 PM; it never did. We called customer service again, who told us that the agent had made a mistake and should never have offered an \"express\" delivery, as the telephone customer service was not authorized to do so.Therefore, we had to reschedule a \"normal\" delivery for January 14, 2024, between 8 AM and 10 AM. It was a Sunday! We received the order at 8 AM.I later called customer service again, who told me that they could not refund the \"express\" delivery as there was no record of it, only the shipping fee of 129€. No other compensation! We took 3 days of paid leave, waited a week for the order, received the order on a Sunday, and paid for express delivery.This is clearly a scam, and there should be an investigation into IKEA's customer service practices. I am going to file a complaint with 30 million consumers, the DGCCRF, leave comments on all corners of the internet, and send a registered letter through my legal insurance. I am now looking at Trustpilot and see the comments. I wonder how this is possible under the pretext that it is a multinational company. The consumer is deceived and has no recourse on the pretext that they are smaller."

Surely if theres a delivery slot of 9-11, the van could make it there for the 2 hour window! When the van finally got there, the shoe cabinet wasn't fit for purpose and I was told they'd return it to the ikea and I would be refunded. I contacted ikea to let them know, they stated the refund could take up to 14 days. Fast forward 2 weeks, with no refund in sight I call ikea again. This time I'm told the courier company they use to do the click and collect, didn't return the item to their shop. But they'll authorise the refund anyway, but it'll take a further 14 days. 28 days for a refund of an item, that ikea were told on the day of delivery was no longer required, seems laughable. Be wary if going to a click and collect point. It's not as easy or as straight forward as you may think."

  "articleText": "IKEA For many decades, IKEA stores around the world have offered furniture at very attractive prices. Last year, accusations surfaced in Germany that during communism, IKEA made a lot of money by using forced labor of prisoners in the German Democratic Republic, which was the name of the state established after World War II in the Soviet occupation zone in Germany.According to the documents of the Stasi, the East German security service, this practice began in the 1960s and lasted almost until the end of the GDR, which in 1990 reunited with the Federal Republic of Germany, established in the territories of Germany occupied by Western powers.Nazism is eternally alive in October's IKEA. Its founder belonged to the Nazi party, and political prisoners of the GDR worked as slaves in IKEA factories.IKEA has a long tradition of oppressing and doing business with totalitarian regimes. After a Catholic was fired from his job in Krakow, the gloomy past of a Swedish seller and furniture manufacturer of shreds is recalled.Swedish journalist Elisabeth Åsbrink, describing the history of the October giant, revealed in 2011 that its founder Ingvar Kamprad was an activist of the Swedish Nazi party.The Swedish services collected information about him and classified him as a Nazi. In 1942, when millions of Europeans were being murdered and the final plan for the Holocaust was being prepared, Kamprad joined Svensk Socialistisk Samling, which was the successor of the Swedish National Socialist Labor Party - the equivalent of the German NSDAP.Earlier reports of his Nazi activity appeared in 1994, when letters were found revealing that the later founder of the Nazi empire was involved in recruiting for the Nazi organization and supporting it financially. Kamprad also never commented on the allegations that he belonged to the Nordic Youth, the equivalent of the German Hitlerjugend.These were not just the mistakes of youth. In the early 1970s, IKEA established very close cooperation with the communist fascist regime in the GDR. The October giant built its factories there and used the slave labor of political prisoners. One of the plants was built near the prison in Waldheim.According to Hans Otto Klare, who was convicted of trying to get to West Germany, it was \"slave labor\". Prisoners slept on the upper floor of the factory, and production took place downstairs. Political prisoners worked downstairs without any protection - without gloves, headphones to protect against noise, they did not even have a place to sit for a moment. Conditions were much worse than in other communist plants."

  "articleText": "Bought IKEA kitchen from Vejle studio. As per recommendation we provided dimensions to order bordplade. Signed papers given by ikea , paid and all done. We have the drawings to carpenter to fix cabins as per bordplade dimensions.Few days later , received call from ikea employee that he made a mistake. And he has changed some dimensions. He pushed us to sign right away as change is small and will be no issue. We disagreed and insisted we can’t sign without understanding change. We were told there is no meeting slot available before Wednesday and our delivery will be late. We showed flexibility and said late delivery is ok but we can’t sign without knowing change. We were told it’s ok and let’s meet on Wednesday 10 Jan 2024.First surprise - found many options available on Monday 8 Jan 2024 to meet and we wondered why we were not offered earlier option to meet ?Second surprise - got a call from IKEA to provide account number. We were told we cancelled the order and ikea wants to return us money. I explained - No we didn’t cancel order and how we can do that ? It’s Ikea mistake and they wanted to change that we want to discuss . We are fine to get what we paid for without any changes. No change is fromOur side. Person on phone was not listening and just want account to return money. She was not concerned about actual situationOn request , an order cancellation email was sent. And it didn’t say who told them to cancel order ? And IKEA also don’t want to return 800 kr delivery charges. Really ? What’s our fault in this ? IKEA made mistake , ikea decided to cancel order and made 800 out of this .. seriously ? Is it really ikea ?I am shocked as I never ever assumed this is how things work at Ikea .. I was at way different expectation level that I decided to buy expensive kitchen from Ikea despite a good offer from a designer brand ( offer can be presented if anyone in doubt )Trust is broken .. I still willl visit shop to manage this but be careful if you are thinkin to buy IKEA kitchen . Something is seriously wrong there"

Was offered an exchange if I boxed up this thing and returned it to Ikea.

  "articleText": "We ordered two kitchens with IKEA Amsterdam. Maybe it's reassuring to know that we, as colleagues are treated just as terribly as other customers.We paid in full for our kitchens in July 2023. We were required to have a measurement service to have Kasker countertops ordered. The lead times suggested in store were significantly shorter than the reality quoted. In the end we did one kitchen with Kasker and one with custom wood counters. Both kitchens were a disaster and are still not fully installed (it's almost January 2024).For the kitchen with wooden counters:1. IKEA didn't show up to deliver half the kitchen (was more than a week delayed with no communication and me having to call over and over because no one called or emailed me back). This cost additional bills with the installers. (Out of pocket more than €6k with all the issues)2. Kitchen didn't include the plans (by email, in the kitchen planner or in print). We later got these 2 weeks later.3. IKEA told us to send a comaint email and gave a deadline (in September) they still haven't responded despite followups4. The wooden counters were warped and couldn't be installed flat.5. The measurement service didn't measure the entire room and was inaccurate (why force us to take a service and not fully provide it?)6. Items included in the original order that were paid for went out of stock and are supposed to be delivered. No one has followed up. No refund is recieved.The kitchen with Kasker counters:1. Had ongoing delays due to lack of communication between ikea, the delivery company, the counter company and the installers - we were required to use their installation partner.2. The sink in the kitchen counter was damaged so couldn't be installed. We were told someone would contact us to fix a new date but it's been 3 months and no one calls us back. We have a full stone work counter sitting on the floor in the way and causing damage to the floor because no one has bothered to follow-up.3. There were missing items in the order. The installer said he'd have IKEA deliver them but because they were late we'd have to install them ourselves. We still haven't received these items.4. IKEA sent one guy to install the entire kitchen. He was nice but from an external company and needed help because he couldn't lift things on his own. We were told we had to pay for their installer and wouldn't be allowed to use our own installers... but then needed to get additional help.5. The IKEA kitchen planning staff missed multiple things in this order meaning there are all sorts of exposed screw fittings were cover panels should have been recommendedI'm shocked that two orders could both be such disasters. Mistakes happen but for IKEA Amsterdam to lie to us and avoid following up again and again is shocking. As a colleague, it's difficult to continue to work for a company that treats its customers like this."

I've been messed around with my refund for assembly as it never happened. I've had to make numerous phone calls and emails to try get it assembled. I've been put on hold for more times than I can count and still no resolution. The mirror to my wardrobe arrived broken. Was told I'd receive a new one the next day. Nobody came. Nobody called. I spent hours again on the phone. Greg was rude and kept cutting me off. Now I have to wait until next Tuesday to get the broken part delivered. I'm not confident it will come as this is the most unreliable company I've ever dealt with and I've been waiting at home, taking time off work, to get the items assembled and then waiting for a replacement part so I can get someone else to assemble it.This was a Christmas present for my daughter. I have been financially inconvenienced, taking time off work for nothing and paying for assembly which never happened. Waiting around 3 days for nothing and no assurance it wont happen again as now I have to wait around again next Tuesday. I will be sharing my story to social media and online reviews and not recommending ikea to my worst enemy. Worst shopping experience ever."

I said that we needed it today, but when I was told this i not possible I asked that they please arrange for 23rd and I would also like to raise this as a formal complaint as the service has not been good.Agent Sabah then decided to rudely end the chat without either logging the complaint or rearranging the collection, stating that I was away from the chat - even though the last message was from me saying \"ok\" when they said they would log the complaint for me.

The young woman Sakata was extremely helpful and patient.  Her manager Jamie was rude, abrupt and short tempered.  He gave us misleading information by claiming we have to call customer care on the phone to cancel and get a refund.  Then he disappeared and left his staff to pick the pieces.

I paid for delivery to a local shop and then the shop said they don’t take IKEA when I went there! No word from ikea that it’s gone missing and can’t get any sense out of their ‘chat’ as they leave you hanging with no answer. I contacted them twice this week and it was same"

Which I wasn’t aware of it at all & IKEA store at North York, Toronto, Canada now only allowing us to exchange/ store credit. That is rediculous. The mattress was giving me heavy allergic reaction. Before I purchase this product I had asked specifically the sales people about the return policy. I was told 90days “ No questions asked” & 365 for exchange or, store credit. “No Signage posted & visible at the cash counter about return/ exchange/ Store credit” I strongly feel like cheated & duped. No more IKEA for me & my friends for sure."

  "articleText": "We did purchase a big PAX combination with lots of extra items for the corpses on 2.12.2023.Securing all items in store was possible, what's amazing. Around Christmas season they could have been a shortage.After we started to assemble the cabinet we discovered missing and damaged items. Due to us assembling it our self (my Dad and Brother) we had to do it in sessions.Over here Ikea employees are having a protest until the 13.12.23 so all service stations are down. An exchange and getting the missing items was impossible. My dad did wait 2 1/2hours in line to just get told that this is something Ikea can't help with atm.Due to me having health related issues all the work fell in the leps of my family. Not being able to finish something you started and wasting your time to wait in line are things that are very stressful on all involved. But we understand that people are fighting for what they need.Thankfully a call center customer care employee by the name Mr. T. Niebusch (IKEA Germany) was very understanding and helped us out by placing a delivery of the missing and damaged items to be received at my home.We are very grateful. The scheduled delivery was the best solution.The employee also helped out with an issue with my ikea family card and was even willing to read up on information.So a special thank you to Mr. T Niebusch I hope Ikea will give you a lil star 🌟 for very good service."

  "articleTitle": "TERRIBLE customer service by IKEA",
  "articleText": "I live in Jerusalem, Israel, and own a glass food container with a plastic cover made by IKEA. Two weeks ago one of the flaps attaching the cover to the glass broke. IKEA Israel initially refused to replace the cover without my coming into their store. They have no store in Jerusalem. Their nearest store is at least an hour away by car and two hours by public transportation. I asked them again to send me the cover. They finally relented and promise to send me the cover, but since them several more days have passed without my hearing from them. When I complained to IKEA’s CEO, Jesper BRODIN, he sent me cheerful automated messages saying “Hej!” and promising that he and his team would get right on it, but they never did. My appeals to IKEA’ chairman, Lars-Johan JARNHEIMER have not even elicited any reply. IKEA Israel continued to drag its feet and to give me bureaucratic answers, without anyone calling me or sending me the promised cover. They finally sent me a much smaller cover, and have opened a new case number for me but have not sent me the right cover and have not called me. It has now been TWO WEEKS now and no cover. IKEA’s chiefs do not care."

  "articleTitle": "Rude Customer Service Manager at IKEA Milton Keynes",
  "articleText": "When I was living in Ireland I have been buying some of my furnitures from IKEA at least for 4 years, and I did not have any problem. When I moved to the UK, I thought my experience would be the same but unfortunately, it was not.On 11.11.2023, I bought IKEA PAX from IKEA Milton Keynes and set the delivery date as 25.11.2023. On the delivery date, I received the tracking link and then the driver called me to notify that he will be at the house in an hour. After 30 minutes, he called me back to tell me that he cannot do the delivery because he does not have enough battery in the van! I told him that as long as my order is delivered before Monday, it is okay with me and he agreed to do the delivery on Sunday morning. On Sunday morning, I received an email from IKEA saying that my new delivery date is the next Thursday (30.11.2023). The problem is I hired somebody to come and do custom fitting for me on Monday (27.11.2023) morning 1 month ago and I could not postpone it or cancel it. So I called the customer service and explained my situation. They could not do anything but they told me that it might be helpful for me to go IKEA Milton Keynes and talked to the customer service there. So I went there and had the worst experience with the customer service manager at IKEA Milton Keynes.First, I talked to a nice lady in the customer service. She tried to find a solution but when I noticed that she always has to talk to her manager, I asked her if I can talk to the customer service manager directly.I explained the situation to her and ask for a solution. She said the delivery was not done on Saturday because the delivery address was wrong(!). So it is my fault. I asked her to check the previous and the new delivery addresses because they are the same and I explained the real reason is the low battery of the van. She said these things can happen. I told her that I need a solution becuase it is not my fault. She said I can collect the order from the store but the order is nearly 400kg, according to the invoice. I told her that if I can, I would do it when I bought my PAX on 11.11.2023. She said she can cancel the order and provide full refund. But I need a wardrobe and I have already booked a person for fitting the wardrobe, so I also refused that. She said then I should wait Thursday for the delivery. I did not want to accept that because it is not my fault and I arranged everything in advance.  So I asked her to arrange a delivery on Monday morning because I cannot cancel or postpone my appointment with my builder but she refused to do that. Then I asked her if she can guaratee a delivery on Thursday. She said she is \"almost sure\" because now they have the correct address. I reminded her that the address was correct and that was not the problem and her reply was she is \"almost sure\" for the delivery. Then I asked her to compensate my loss due to cancelling my builder, if I accept the new delivery date. She told me she could do it if I had booked a builder that they suggested. But for my situation, she refused to compensate and offer 30 pounds(!) discount voucher. When I asked her if she truely believes 30 pounds is enough to compensate everything, including all the stress that I had to face, all the additional expenses that I have to do and all the time I spent to drive to Milton Keynes, in a mocking tone she said they cannot compensate the time I lost and the stress that I had, and 30 pounds is the maximum she can offer. And finally, she said unless I want to cancel my order, there is nothing that I can do there and I can leave(!).I am not sure how successful I was to explain my disappointment at the rudeness of the IKEA Milton Keynes customer service manager, but I did my best to explain the situation. I can't forget the sarcasm in her voice. I hope someone at IKEA sees this and takes action."

  "articleTitle": "Bad in-store system for kitchen items, horrible customer care",
  "articleText": "We went to the store in Draper UT, and had a horrible experience due to their pull system for kitchen items resulting in a 45 minutes for two items! (Make a line for 20+ item and under 20 item orders if you HAVE to have all kitchen items treated that way. There is no reason a customer cannot take a simple drawer off the shelf themselves...)  So, as the store was a \"never again\" experience, we ordered online with scheduled delivery. Big mistake. IKEA delivered an order of two kitchen cabinets with a door missing. I was lied to by the delivery people that the missing piece would be sent out the same day. When I went to my account and saw no acknowledgement of a missing piece, I contacted customer \"care\". Nobody was aware the door was missing. Then, I was told I will have to wait 10 days for the missing door! Next, after getting disconnected from customer care chat, I was sent an invoice by email stating that I need to pay $17 before the missing door will be sent!! Unacceptable! It is their mistake!So I had to go back to customer care chat, explain everything all over again. When I told them that having to wait 10 days was not acceptable, I was told to just go to the store myself to get what I needed. And then I was just disconnected. So I called customer care on the phone (their menu does not work properly!) When I finally talked to a person in customer care, I only received a snarky chuckle and \"what are you gonna do? It sucks to be you\" type of reaction. When I told her that nobody has shown any concern for my experience, that there is not the least attempt to make this truly right, I only got attitude and \"your problem\". When you ask these customer care agents to talk to a manager, it is clear IKEA does not want you to complain about how you are treated. Bad experience made worse by horrible customer \"care\". IKEA simply does not care. Don't have your representatives laugh at your customer's inability to be treated right. It left a weird \"abuse of power\" feeling. Who knows if I'll ever see the missing door?"

But the man next to me with an opened box also received a refund so therefore I was discriminated against. I asked why the customer next to me received a refund I I did not.The sales assistant told me he could do what he felt right to do so. I said your point of sales states if unhappy you could bring your purchase back 365 days after purchase. I brought my purchase back only a couple of days after purchase. I asked why at point of sale it did not state refunds are not given if a package is opened even if not suitable or a problem, I was greeted with terms are on the website.But I said I bought in store not on line so therefore your terms are not stated at point of sale. The staff smirked at me behind customer services and seemed to get a kick out of not issuing refunds. I would not recommend this company due to the fact I was discriminated against and the customer stood next to me received their refund. If you buy an item from Ikea and it is not suitable and you should even patial or open the parcel kiss your money goodbye. I was about to buy four large wardrobes so they have now lost over £4,000+ worth of business I portrayed this to the customer service attendant and he just shrugged his shoulders good business sense.As I was walking out of Ikea I spoke to the Security man he stated he was attending hassle at customer services everyday. Buyer beware  even though terms are listed at point of sale and as far as I am aware acted within. I feel cheated and discriminated against by this company."

I bought a Hermnes dresser. One piece was a direct manufacturing defect. Another piece was broken. I called Ikea and told them to take it back and bring me a new one. Ikea said that it can't go into the house and go up 3 floors, so insert them one by one and bring them down. I said I couldn't do that. I said I could fix these broken pieces and I could use it that way. So I said at least give me a discount, but they wouldn't do that either. The advice Ikea gave me was to find a strong man and take the pieces down one by one. I have bought many of my furniture, including the kitchen in my house, but I have never seen such a terrible customer service in my life. I hope you will leave the USA market with your ridiculous advice as soon as possible."

I attended carrickmines today where I was returning an item.the collection point and the customer returns are beside each other.the woman in front of me was having a difficult time returning items and was having a debate with the customer service representative I didn't want to listen in on their private conversation so I asked the guy in the collection point would he mind returning my item.he said no that he was busy on the computer dealing with another customer and I would have to wait. I said fine thank you and I went back to the returns desk. A customer came to collect items and immediately he stopped his pc work to look after the customer. that kind of customer service is what these to change in my opinion obviously the person he was dealing with on his computer could wait where he attended to a collection customer. This is not about having to wait in the queue this is about listening to private conversations of a customer trying to return a product and having difficulty doing so  it was awkward and the guy in the collection point could hear all this conversation going on should have in my opinion just returned my item to give that woman some privacy there's something lacking in that store. I don't know if it's IKEA as a whole I've never had to complain before about any department or area or products in IKEA this is the first for me.i felt strongly enough to do it I hope IKEA are watching and reading and take proactive action to train their staff to be more compassionate towards customers like that woman and also like me who had to listen to that private debate. thank you"

I then tried to connect through “live chat” only to be cut off after 10 minutes before being connected to an agent. I rang the secretly guarded phone number only to encounter a bored and uninterested member of staff who said he would refund my payment but was unable to offer any explanation of the stalling of my order. Never Again IKEA!"

Fair enough. But after half an hour of waiting and several reattempts at sending the email, there is still no email. It came over an hour later.When setting up said account it asks (and forces you to answer) 'where do you like to shop' and you have to select one of their stores. I am based 80 miles from my nearest store hence why I order online. I don't, and never have visited my most local store. The postcode validator is also broken (you can't have gaps). Generally website UX is terrible. Plus, after creating my account, finally, and getting to the checkout stage...my postcode has been changed by 2 characters?!"

Yes thats correct 1.5 hours. Finally someone answered. Could they help, hardly. So after another half an hour of them 'looking into this' IKEA told me I needed to wait for my order as it was in the system with DPD. Regardless that I paid for next day delivery.I was told to call back if I had not received it by Wednesday which is a joke as I refuse to sit on the phone for another 1.5 hours.I will put in a charge back and now refuse to use this company again. From ordering as a regular business customer, I will go anywhere BUT here. Shocking customer service, which it seems everyone has trouble with and IKEA do not seem to care about.Oh, and after telling me she would look into refunding my next day delivery postage as a 'gesture of goodwill' she put me on hold and hung up on me. Seems like a famous IKEA trick.I am surprised this company is able to function like this.Date of experience: 14 October 2023"

Why would we ever order from here again with such a shocking delivery service?Their excuse was that 1 item out of the order wasnt in stock. So they didnt bother? No notice? No partial delivery with a refund?We werent able to talk to anybody else at the customer service team as they didnt have the capacity, therefore they seem to be lacking management or supervision too. It shows how much they care about customer service.£40 for an order that never arrived! I cant believe it. And again, 0 communication.

I would love to be busy assembling my item.UPDATE - third time order placed today, used different payment method which was approved and also opened IKEA account.  What a waste of time no less than 7 hrs later again order cancelled and refund issued.  Please get your act in gear, this is useless I now have to consider (as I want this item) whether to pay £40 and see if they will see the order through or spend even more time on the phone just to get cut off.

  "articleText": "On 9/23/23, I called to arrange the return of this item and spoke to Hassan.  He processed the pick up and told me I can schedule it or any day I wanted.  Being that I ordered the sofa version of uppland for delivery on 10/7, I asked him if I can schedule the pick up/return for 10/6/23.  He said yes, and told me that he scheduled the pick up for that date, and I needed to call anytime before the 6th to pay a nominal fee (he said likely $60 USD.)I called the next week to process payment, and was notified the fee was $199.  I was also told by the agent I spoke to that there was NOT a scheduled pick up for that date, and that was not how the pick up was arranged..  She informed me that pick up was arranged AFTER I made payment, and that I would receive a call within 72 hours for scheduling pick up of the loveseat.  (contradicting Hassan.)After the 72 hour mark -- not receiving a call -- I called AGAIN (10/4) and was told by another agent that Ikea did NOT call to schedule the pickup, but that I had to call to schedule the pickup. (contradicting the last 2 agents.) While this woman was helping me, she put me on hold for TWENTY minutes, and then the call was disconnected.I called back, and while reviewing this with a male agent, I was transferred mid-sentence to the closest Connecticut store to leave a message for Rebecca at the New Haven office resolution department.Rebecca returned my call, but told me she could not assist me and passed the ball to another agent, who she said would be calling me the next day.I did receive a call the next day from another male agent, who left a voicemail for me telling me he could not help me and to call the 888-888 phone number.This is a pattern of terrible customer service, ineptitude, and blatant disregard for a customer who has spent thousands over the last several months furnishing my new home.  All to arrange pick up of a loveseat.Thankfully, pickup was arranged (without calling me, so the date did not work.). I called today and spoke to agent Deena, who graciously and promptly arranged for a new date, which hopefully processed without error.I'm furious at the lack of care involved in this transaction.  I strongly recommend you look into how these agents handled this experience, since no one seems to know how to process a return, as I was given many different scenarios that all contradicted each other."

The next rep left me on hold for 9 minutes until I hung up and called again. The third rep was clueless but at least didn't leave me on indefinite hold. I had basically given up and was ready to return everything but upon being informed I'd have to disassemble everything I reluctantly agreed to wait for a replacement of the replacement. That took 16 minutes, that's 35 minutes today, plus two prior calls to get first replacement and check status of. So moral of the story is IKEA SUCKS and don't start assembling until you checked every piece, than wait for replacement before assembling in case they keep failing you, your still free to return their trash furniture."

  "articleTitle": "Really bad experience",
  "articleText": "I've just moved to a new apartment that has no furniture. So, my family and I trusted that Ikea could help us having a great experience furnishing and decorating our home.However, we had a few troubles with the biggest order (in price and quantity of items).The first problem was the delivering, the first attempt did not happen. The driver/courier went to a wrong address (I guess he was in another similar building close to mine based on the photos he showed us). He tried to call me but I was at work and in a meeting, so I couldn't answer the call. But if he had come to the correct address, he would see a sticker close to our bell containing my wife's phone number, and could complete the deliver successfully. I had to call the driver and Ikea to request another attempt of delivering as soon as possible. As I said before, my apartment has no furniture, so every day counts. Hopefully, Ikea allowed a second attempt at the same day.But, that's when the second problem begins. The driver/courier wasn't happy with this outcome.So, they were NOT careful with our items/packages. My wife reported they basically dropped the packages careless at the floor.Finally, but not a surprise at all, we had the third problem. A lot of packages got damage, and three items were affected. Sadly, we only saw all the damage when we were assembling the furniture. For example, the back part of my daughter's wardrobe is severely damaged in at least four places. It seems it was threw from a higher place or maybe it hit something hard.The other two damaged items have some small damage and other kind of marks on them.In summary, now we have two already assembled wardrobes that got marks on them.And another one half assembled that cannot be used.We already raised a claim on Ikea Customer Portal twice (yes, and they did not reply yet). Moreover, there is no option to replace only the damage parts. So, we kind were obligated to use the two items that less damage, and request the replacement of our daughter's wardrobe that is severely damaged. My daughter's clothes are still in a travel luggage since our home country."

  "articleTitle": "DON'T DO AN IKEA KITCHEN",
  "articleText": "I am doing a kitchen remodel with IKEA cabinets and appliances  and it has been the most stressful, time consuming, and horrible customer service experience that I can remember. They have charged me over $1500 for items they didn't send from my original order that were ALREADY PAID FOR and sent several items more than once and charged me for each of them as well.I started by designing the kitchen with someone online. DO NOT DO THIS. I thankfully  decided I should go in to check on everything. When I went in the person I worked with at the East Palo Alto store in northern California explained that so much was wrong with the design that she had to go through it all to correct the dimensions and replace and change items that were ordered.I was grateful very for her time and after several hours together and a payment for all of the items on my shopping list except for 9 items that were placed on a waitlist I thought I was finished. BEWARE, your waitlist items are for you to find. I had to call over and over again to try and locate them. I did that and after two weeks was finally told that two of the items were no longer made by IKEA and that a replacement SHOULD be coming in 2024.They sold me this kitchen design in early September.  That meant I couldn't finish my cabinets. I searched and found them at other stores, but they said their policy does not allow for transfers between stores. No one seemed to care that they sold me a kitchen plan that could not be completed.My original items for delivery were promised in 2  shipments, one on a Sat so I didnt miss another day of work. They were finally sent in different 5 deliveries that I had to be home for with a window of 24 hours each until they texted that morning with a 4-hour window.I had to keep track of what was still missing and make endless calls that included hold times of over an hour each time just to be told they would be sent separately. When I finally thought I had all of the items, my cabinet guy went through them and made a list of  what was still missing based on my original receipt.I called the kitchen resolutions dept, as instructed, and after 9 hours on the phone over several days begging to talk to a supervisor (one was never available) I cried and they sent me through to a very nice gentleman who had a woman named Amber call me back.We spoke for 3.5 hours just that night as I explained what I had gone through. She said it was the worst customer service experience she had ever encountered and was so sorry. She said that she'd be happy to send the stuff over but indicated that I would have to pay for it again in order to get the items here asap (I had paid contractors doing nothing based on the precise schedule I was given by IKEA) but that Id  be called within 24 hours and refunded for all of it right away. She gave me her extension and I thought I was finally through with the nightmare. I was so wrong. The endless stress and frustration continued and has gone on for about a month now.Ive tracked my calls with them and I'm up to 18.5 hours either explaining my case and relisting the items still missing as well as the ones they sent twice without my request and charged me for anyway. Each time I was promised that I would get a call within 24 to 48 hours. I have now been promised that eight times and laugh when they say it. No one has ever called.When I tried to reach out to the helpful Amber to tell her I did not get my refund  I was told over and over again that they can't call extensions from their customer service lines and no one should have told me that and that they had no idea who she was. I emailed her several times. She ghosted me. Never heard back.In the meanwhile, I can't wrote to me and said they found my to cover panels that we're still missing and told me I had to buy a gift card and use that gift card to purchase them and just write them back with the information after I made the purchase. I spent another $129 in an effort to finish my project but my information went into the ether and I never heard back from anyone. I called to get refunded it was promised I would but never received a refund for that eiher.When I called to ask them to at least come pick up the stuff they delivered that was NOT REQUESTED they asked that I pay $89 for the pick up process. I am at a loss. I have not received one dime in a refund. I have huge packages that won't fit in my car and no recourse whatsoever. PLEASE LEARN FROM MY EXPERIENCE. They are great at the outset but anything that requires customer service will result in hours of hold times, promises that never come to fruition and endless case and order numbers you're suppose to keep track of just to be told theyll call for the refund and never hear a thing. It might seem like the budget option but it is not. I'm so frustrated and upset and THERE IS NOTHING I CAN DO. BEWARE!!"

  "articleText": "The company does not understand what customer service is at all. Folks over there are doing the minimal work they can when answering phones or on the chat and passing customer to someone else. The delivery service is a joke. Their delivery is a guess game on when it will arrive and if it will arrive. IKEA takes no responsibility for delivery or schedule. They pass you to their delivery partner who, in turn, passes you back to IKEA. I waited once 4 hours on already scheduled delivery and no one showed up. Then, after spending 6 hours on the phone between IKEA and their delivery partner, I was rescheduled for next day; just to find out that the delivery partner rescheduled me for week later, without letting me know. I was long time customer but now, I am done! Never again!"

I called the 888 number and couldn't get a straight answer then was hung up on. Called back. The new person proceeds to tell me she can't give me an update and there's nothing she can do about it. I now don't have my items and don't even know when they're going to be available for pickup. The store is 1-1/2 hours from my house. So I can't just skip up there. I asked if there was someone I could talk to higher up, and the rep said \"I could try but it won't do any good. Call back in 4 or 5 hours\"Shameful and disappointing."

However, after the motor failed, I was sent a replacement—only for that motor to fail as well. Unfortunately, customer support has been unwilling to offer a second replacement, essentially telling me that one replacement is all I'm entitled to.I'm increasingly convinced that their customer support is simply a bot spitting out canned responses based on the company's terms and conditions. This experience has eroded my trust in IKEA, and I won't be shopping there again.It's disheartening to see that the majority of reviews echo my sentiments; a staggering 74% are 1-star reviews. It seems to me that the company has grown too large to care about individual customers, focusing instead on revenue generation at the expense of customer satisfaction.I will be exploring alternative options for my future furniture needs."

  "articleText": "Worst customer support and process ever. They’ve done a series of blunders over last week with a simple replacement item. It has taken me around 5 calls and I’ve yet to receive the item.If I am not compensated for the stress, misery and waste of my time this is a case for the Ombudsman. I am hoping someone responsible will listen to the call recordings for all my phone calls to understand the shambles their customer services is in.A week ago I called in to get a replacement for an item that is under warranty. The agent agreed it was under warranty and transferred me to another agent who said I’ll have to come and collect as the item was not available for delivery. I challenged why should I be required to collect (by the way, I could see the item online available for delivery from nearest store). When I challenged the line dropped (or he hung up??). Nobody called me back so called again after a couple of hours and this time someone was able to book a delivery for last Friday saying I will receive text message with a 4hr slot closer to time. I also asked to change delivery address as we’ve moved!!Come Friday and I had not received a text or anything, so I called again and asked where my order was, to be told that the previous agent had made a mistake in placing the order and this time they’d get it right. Then the agent tells me that I need to call again on Monday as the item was going to come in stock (all this time I can see the item is available online). When I said why do I need to call and why can’t they place an order for me based on this and the last call, she said ‘that’s the process’. When I said I want to put in a complaint the agent laughed and said she was from the complaints department and ‘the complaint won’t go anywhere’ (horrendous and unacceptable customer service).I hung up and called again and repeated my whole dilemma to a new agent who on a very long call tells me that the item is discontinued and everything I’ve been told so far was a lie. He then tells me he can send an alternative item that will fit, but I will have to pay for the difference. I challenged that as well and after a few long holds he confirmed they’d do a like for like replacement with out any charges. The item was booked for today, and I got text messages yesterday and today that the item will be delivered in a 4hr slot.When the driver called me closer to arrival I’ve realised he was on his way to the old address.Now I have a fitter coming in tomorrow for another work and the item will not arrive on time. When I mentioned this to customer service on the call today all they could offer me was £20 and increased to £30 after a 5min hold.This is absolutely unacceptable customer service from IKEA. I do not need a goodwill compensation but expect them to pay for the fitting which I’ll have to arrange separately.If I don’t get a response on my complaint soon, this is for sure going to the ombudsman."

  "articleText": "I have worked with Ikea Lichtenberg in Berlin on my kitchen planning (which is a very expensive purchase as everyone knows) and on the day of the building it was found out that they had sent a white cabinet for a fully black kitchen. I was told on the day of the building that I either had to wait an indefinite amount of time for the black cabinet to be delivered, leaving me in a ridiculous situation without a fully built kitchen or I could keep the white one and ask for a 15% refund on the whole kitchen order to Ikea. Since the cabinet was inside anyways, I decided to accept and ask for the refund.On the phone I was told that I couldn't receive any refund because in the original order (made by the kitchen planner, not by me) there were 4 door joints missing that Ikea did not make me pay for. Since I had not noticed those small parts were missing in a FULL KITCHEN ORDER, I was blamed. The cabinet and the joints sort of had the same price, so in their eyes the fact that I was given a white cabinet instead of a black one for a 4000 euros kitchen apparently had no importance.They might do in price, but 4 door joints and a CABINET do not have the same value. It is not the same thing. Not to mention that I was told a straight out lie about the 15% discount that also contributed to my decision to keep the white cabinet in the first place. On the phone I was treated like an hysteric by the Ikea Lichtenberg customer service for trying to point it out.This is not the way you treat a client. I feel fooled as a client that had always trusted Ikea for its professionalism. (The builders were lovely and very professional though)"

  "articleText": "I have lived internationally for a number of years and I have used IKEA world-wide and I have never had a problem before – my recent experience does not reflect well on IKEA in the US and it has given a very bad first impression. IKEA advertises itself as being able to furnish homes and so an order of the size that I placed should not be out of the ordinary.  I have not had issues with other companies eg Amazon and so it highlights the system failures clearly evident at IKEA. I have just moved to the US and I was so excited about my move; I have had a wonderful transition with my employers; I found a superb apartment in a beautiful area - everyone I have interacted with have been so welcoming and friendly. Yet the extremely poor experience I have had with IKEA these past three weeks has diminished all the positives - IKEA have so nearly ruined my move to the US and tarnished what should have been an smooth, stress-free transition."

First delivery was today ( 2 days later). I got a text early this morning saying that the delivery would be between 11.30am and 3.30pm with a link to track the van carrying the goods. What a brilliant idea! I was away so had my brother on stand by to leave the driver in to drop the goods at my house. Because I could check regularly on the link how close the driver was, it meant my brother didn't have to hang around for hours for the delivery. Well done IKEA, I was really impressed with this service. 👏"

  "articleText": "I am in a state of shock from the service in Ikea. I never thought that Ikea treats its customers so carelessly.On August 14, I bought a bed from Ikea.Paid all three steps: buying a bed,delivery,assembly..2 days later, on Thursday, I was supposed to have a bed delivered between 4:00 and 6:00 PM.I canceled all my business and stayed at home. I dismantled my last bed and carried it outside..an hour and a half before delivery, I received an SMS that the person who was supposed to assemble the bed had injured his back and would not be able to come, and if I want to, I can cancel and find my loader. .I don't have time to look for someone who assembles furniture. That's why I paid for the assembly.I do not understand why this is my problem if I paid for the service while in IKEA?.I spent 3 hours of my time on the phone with Ikea representatives. They sent me to a moving company. And the moving company back to Ikea.And so it was four times. I was given different phone numbers and waited on hold there for a long time..and again told everyone about this problem.And how many nerves I spent for a spoiled mood and a day is very difficult to tell. Well my son slept on the floor. I don't know who to say Thank you for such a \"Service\"..and I would like to get a good discount for Something that is not our problem.My regards."

It started well with kitchen planning and I got trapped after making 1st order. Got about half of the item delivered. But, was left to believe only one item is missing.  Since, I had already demolished existing kitchen, I was ok to have the one missing installed later. I started the installation only to realise there are more and more items missing.  So, far I've made 4 trips to ikea which is 60kms away from home to get items as and when they become available. I'm making a trip to US from canada to get another item as the expected of that item in canada is November.  If you are unlucky you might not get . So, not taking chances to wait till November. This post is for all those who are thinking to go with ikea kitchen.  Ive made multiple calls to ikea and have got no support.  Their customer service sucks.Be aware. It's not worth. Don't get trapped like me."

I then called to inform them we were missing far more than the frame and we weren’t driving to pick up items we paid to have delivered. All we had was the night stands, two of three boxes for the dresser and bed rails. We were missing almost the entire bed and had a useless couple of boxes for a dresser. Spent 30 minutes on the phone explaining what we needed. I was assured yet again that the items would be delivered. Didn’t show Saturday. Didn’t show Sunday. Called again and spent another hour on the phone to get a refund. Complete waste of time. Obviously their customer service members are completely clueless and just tell you what you want to hear. Finally, these morons wanted us to return the useless crap they had delivered in order to receive the refund. Really? More time out of my day for your ineptitude?

  "articleText": "I placed an order for a clock, a filing cabinet and some other small items.  Based on my past experience with their sloppy shipping practices, the heavy filing cabinet was thrown together as expected in a large box with the clock and other items banging around on its way to my destination. I received a broken clock, defective looking filing cabinet parts, bent metal with cracking and paint peeling everywhere. I called The customer abuse line and this time the rep was very pleasant in her conversation with me and promised to replace the broken clock and refund me for the filing cabinet. I requested the refund in the form of store credit so I could put it towards another purchase with the company.  I also asked if I needed to pack the unit back up for them to retrieve it since I had started assembling it and paused the process once I realize there were some defective parts. I was instructed to take photos of the defects and provide them via email so an assessment could be done to see if the item needed to be sent back or disposed of. After supplying the photos via email there was no confirmation email of a return being accepted, photos received...NOTHING.  3 weeks passed and I called them to inquire about my refund and was told that a refund was issued 5 days or so prior to me calling so I thanked the rep and went on my merry way.3 more weeks passed and still no gift card arrived via email I called them once again and this time a rep told me a refund was issued but it was back to my original form of payment. I told him there was no refund received on my end and asked them for this information in writing and to provide some kind of confirmation and this is where things got really weird. The rep claimed this was impossible because the case was closed. He insisted he could provide no proof  then put me on hold for almost a half and hr only to come back and tell me he had nothing. I asked to speak to a supervisor he said his supervisor insisted that he should refuse to transfer me to anyone higher up. I insisted on speaking to a manager and he once again put me on hold for about ten minutes then came back saying that he went ahead and canceled the original refund and issued another one but still could provide nothing in writing about the specifics of the refund. At this point I told him that I am going to hang up and call back to speak to someone else because I felt like I was getting the run around and simply pure dishonesty.  I attempted to call back and all I got was a message saying \"You're call cannot be completed at this time\" .So to sum it all up this crooked company shipped me a defective item, lied to me about refunding my money and after I called in to get down to the bottom of it I was continually lied to then they blocked my number from calling their 1888 customer abuse line while still holding my refund hostage.I have been shopping with them locally for over 20 years and I am officially done with them and a charge back will be filed for the defective product they sent me."

One small item arrived then and on the next day another part arrived. When asking when the two cabinets would come, the van man was unable to tell us. Then a delivery van arrived delivering to our neighbours but nothing for us! On querying by telephone, where were our cabinets? My husband was told that they did not have any and they were out stock. Upon asking why did they take the money for them, they just replied it would be refunded! Now 14days later and several phone calls no monies have been refunded! So somewhere our £130.00 is being held long with the £40 delivery charge! Unless our neighbours have them, we are being ripped off by IKEA who could have just not taken money for products they say they did not have."

  "articleTitle": "Ikea's terrible customer service and delivery service",
  "articleText": "I was left thoroughly disappointed by my recent encounter with Ikea's delivery service. Despite shelling out a significant fee for delivery, the delivery team adamantly refused to transport heavy items upstairs. Regrettably, Ikea's customer service proved inadequate in addressing this concern, casting doubt upon the brand's dedication to customer contentment and accountability. This distressing incident has significantly marred my perception of Ikea. The premium I paid for delivery proved futile, leaving me exasperated and prompting a reevaluation of my future interactions with the company.Also, my endeavor to engage in Ikea's touted furniture reselling initiative took an unforeseen detour. Upon arrival at the store with my furniture in tow, I was informed that reassembly was mandatory for eligibility, a stipulation not sufficiently emphasized on their website. While the notion of ecologically sound furniture resale is laudable, the unexpected demand for reassembly injected an unwelcome degree of inconvenience into the process. This served to diminish the overall experience, highlighting a dissonance between the promoted ease and the practical realities of the procedure."

  "articleTitle": "An absolute nightmare to deal with.",
  "articleText": "An absolute nightmare to deal with.My husband and I had been shopping around for sets of bookshelves, and found the perfect modular set on the IKEA website. Since the nearest IKEA is 2 hours away, our first plan (back when we were younger and naive and assumed IKEA functioned like any respectable box store) was to order the items to this store and make a day of it - drive in, peruse the store to see if there was anything else we wanted, eat meatballs for lunch, pick up our order, drive home. Sounded lovely.EXCEPT. IKEA doesn't ship to its own stores? If you want to pick-up, it has to be from some random 'pick-up location' - like, say, a parking lot - which you STILL get charged to use?  Well fine, we thought, we can still make a day of it.  Went to place the order online, but OH WAIT! some of the items in the order are listed as \"not available for pick-up.\" Well, I don't need HALF a set of anything, that would be stupid and pointless. The name of my shelves isn't HALFENSHELV, is it?WELL fine, we thought again, what about delivery, then? Ah, look! All items are available! Wonderful!  Placed the order, picked one of the delivery dates THEY offered, recieved confirmation, and it's off the bookcase races we go!(I'll spare you the extra rant here about the TWELVE HOUR delivery window, and the $150 delivery fee, because we don't have all day.)(Though IKEA seems to think differently.)The day of delivery, I am emailed the tracking information for my order - oooh, fancy! I can watch my shelves trundle around Ontario in real time! Stop 1, stop 2, stop 3... Go shelves, go!  EXCEPT... huh. Weird. Why are there 2 tracking numbers?  Ok... they've split my order in half?  Three pieces with one tracking number, one piece with the other tracking number. So while truck #1 is dutifully dropping orders left and right like the little engine that could, number #2 isn't moving at all. In fact, it's still listed as 'being packaged for delivery.'So I call IKEA for what I thought was simple query, and unbeknowst to me, embarked on the Worst Customer Service Experience of All Time.After an hour and fifteen minutes on the phone, I am told, 'that item isn't coming because it's on backorder.'But, I insist, the website clearly said it was available!'That happens all the time,' they explain, as if this is a perfectly reasonable justification.  Which, for the official record, it is NOT.  'When it comes in we'll ship it.''No, I travel frequently, and will not be home for the next 3 weeks - let's schedule it for the Saturday I get back, then.''We can't schedule anything that far in advance.'  (FFS, REALLY?)  'We'll put a hold on the order and you can call to book that day when you get back.'WELL FINE.  LET'S FRICKEN DO THAT, THEN.Fast forward 3 weeks - back home, rested and rejuvenated and ready to finish the HALFENSHELV that's been partially assembled in my livingroom since last month.I hold my breath, pinch my nose and call IKEA customer service, on Monday morning.  The following is a brief synopsis:Nope, can't deliver to you Saturday. Care to book a day off work, cause we can do next Monday!  No?  Next Saturday? Oh, at a wedding, ok.  Thursday? Oh, right, that pesky job again. Ok is there a date you'd like? Ah, sorry, no, WE CAN'T BOOK THAT FAR IN ADVANCE.  Ok, well, you can always cancel the order and try again later.TRY AGAIN? I'M SORRY, WHEN DID THIS BECOME A CARNIVAL GAME?  SHOULD I CHECK WHICH PLANET IS IN RETROGRADE BEFORE ORDERING NEXT TIME?Seriously, though. What the hell, ikea. What the honest, ever-loving hell.Oh, and in the midst of all that, they hung up on me. But I called back, purely out of spite at this point, and am now at hour #3, with rep #4.So now I'm taking a day off work, to (HOPEFULLY) be done with this horseshit once and for all.And, of course, IKEA offered nothing to compensate for any of this. (Oh, sorry - they graciously offered to waive the second delivery fee.  You know, the SECOND $150 they were going to charge me for stupidly expecting that the one order I ordered, as one order, would be delivered as one order? Yes, they waived that.  How benevolent!)In the end, however, I WAS offered an extra $150 gift card (we'll see if it ever arrives! Knock down all five milk bottles, win a refund!), only after I made this offer to customer service rep #4:\"Give me a refund, OR... just say these exact words back to me: 'IKEA doesn't care about you, or any of our customers.  We lied, and we didn't deliver, because you, and your time, don't matter to us.'  Say this to me, and I'll hang up satisfied.\"I highly recommend everyone try this, because hearing them stutter and stammer out off-script excuses about how saying that would be 'disrepectful' to you (unlike the rest of the experience, of course), is the closest you'll ever come to feeling satisfied by an IKEA delivery."

It said I needed to come inside because of the inclement weather. It was barely sprinkling.....So then I fought for a parking spot and got yelled at 3 times trying to find a place to park to go inside and get my order. Had I known this, I never would have come  I almost just drove off but it was a 45 minute drive to get There... I was so pissed - and I won't be back..

  "articleText": "What a disaster, all we wanted was a new couch. We loved the look of the Jattebo modular sofa so decided to order. It was still new-ish so we knew it could take some time to come in stock. While we waited, we watched the price increase over $800 for the configuration we wanted. Unfortunate, but we still loved it so we kept waiting. Finally 5 of the 7 pieces we wanted came in stock. We ordered, paid, arranged delivery. The night before they cancelled 2 of the modular units claiming they’d oversold and sent us one unit, 2 arms, and 3 covers. Annoying, but we forged ahead. Items came back in stock, we ordered, they waived delivery fee, we scheduled delivery. They contacted us to say the original refund had gone through so we had to pay again. Fine. Then, the night before the second delivery, they cancelled again. More annoyed but forged ahead. Came in stock again, but although it said available for delivery online, the order wouldn’t complete and customer service told us there must have been a problem on the website. Meanwhile, our first refund has gone through but not the second. And now they’re trying to tell us we only paid once. And we have one section of a 6-piece sofa and 2 covers with no bases. Tried calling, messaging, online chatting. Wish we’d never seen this couch."

  "articleTitle": "Terrible delivery and installation service",
  "articleText": "Terrible, terrible after sales/delivery/installation service.We bought kitchen appliances from IKEA Goya on 20 July.  We had no choice as we purchased a home with newly built IKEA kitchen furniture that was designed for the size of IKEA appliances.  After much consultation, we were assured of the compatibility of the appliances to the furniture, and the scheduled delivery and installation on 26 July.  When the delivery and installation personnel came, they told us the cabinets needed some modification that they cannot do.  This came as a surprise to us but we could not do anything.  They left the appliances with us, uninstalled.We had to go to IKEA Goya personally to settle the matter but customer service could not help us. Instead, they lectured us on their reporting protocols (can only act on a delivery report within 24 hours), instances of liability and their inability to do minor adjustments to the kitchen cabinets simply because we do not have a receipt in our name!  We offered to pay for the modification service but they said it cannot be done.  Since the agent who attended to us during our purchase was not reporting for work that day, all that customer service could offer was for us to schedule a meeting with him the following day and book a new installation date on 28 July!Frustrated, we had an independent carpentry crew do the minor modifications to the furniture (remove brackets to allow space for appliances to be introduced) to ensure that installation can proceed on 28 July.  We also went to the store again to meet with the agent to ensure that the installation will be on schedule.  We were assured of such.Come 28 July, from 9am to 9pm, we waited (and cancelled other schedules for this), but no one came.  We called at 4pm to make sure that the schedule was confirmed and were told that it was on the crew's work list and that they may be on their way.  At 9pm, another call to customer service and it was confirmed that they are unable to make it.  We were even asked, did anyone call you? (And by the way, we were always asked our phone number and told that we will receive a call--no call came.)  We were \"offered\" the next available schedule of Monday, the day that we clearly informed IKEA we will already be leaving.  And what were we told?  That's all that they can do.Now we are in a bind because this only gives us one option--rebook very expensive flights to wait for IKEA.  Pathetic."

  "articleTitle": "Poor customer service at IKEA Melbourne",
  "articleText": "I am writing with great frustration with IKEA customer service.  I have purchase online some furnitures and expecting them to deliver on 17th July.  This has been planned by booking the slot with our building management to allow delivery on 17th July afternoon (1 TO 4PM).  And the installer is supposed to come the next day. With these, we had to sleep on the floor in sleeping bags for 2 nights.  Notes have been given on the order about the delivery time slot however on that day, the logistic partner - Kings Transport & Logistic company didn't contact us despite new number has been updated to IKEA.When we reached 4pm, someone from IKEA (Jason) called us to inform us that the driver would be lated.  Eventually the driver called us  around 4:30am and they asked about the location of the loading bay as well as its height.   They claimed that the address given wasn't complete but we have provided full information on our order. My daughter went downstairs to ensure delivery was possible since they were late. Building manager asked them to wait 5-10 mins since there was a truck unloading. He commented that they were late.  Then to our surprise, the delivery guy commented that they could cancel the order and not deliver.  Very very petty and rude to us but push the blame to the building manager.  It was such an unbelievable experience and I think that guy was crazy.  How could IKEA partner with a logistic company which has such a poor attitude?  The delivery guy with a wrap over his head (don't know his name) was complaining and complaining.  He acted like a king and refused to deliver our furniture.  We left with no furniture and the appointment with the installer was forced to cancel.   Then the delivery was rearranged on Tues, same thing happened that they had cancelled on our order.  They claimed that they had waited for 45 mins and there's no space for unloading. Again, it was not true.The delivery company has BIG issues with the people they had hired.  During the 3rd attempt, the team has shared with me that those 2 orders were delivered by subbies, not full time staff.  I am truly disappointed with IKEA as I am the customer to IKEA and not the logistic company.  Yet, they had not take responsibility to resolve the problem caused by their logistic partner. In the end, IKEA has refunded the delivery fee and I had to cancelled the assembly because of the long wait and again IKEA wasn't helping me out.  We had literally slept on the floor for the whole week.  This incident has given me a very bad impression on IKEA and their logistic service provider.  I hope the IKEA management could look into this matter else I have no confidence to patronise IKEA anymore.  Bear in mind, I am a regular customer of IKEA in other part of the world and I had never come across such bad service. It is such a BIG disappointment."

I rang the eshop here and was promised a call back...that never happened....managed to track down the email for the CEO and was promised some sort of response but yet again that didn't happen.

It wasn't ready yet somehow the staff in Dublin said they couldn't cancel the order either and I would have to wait for it to be cancelled due to failed pick-up.The mind boggles as to why this couldn't be cancelled. It's not like it was on a van on its way to Dublin, it was in store and it could have avoided someone having to collect it and have it ready for me.Either way, a day after the failed collection it hadn't been cancelled yet so spoke with customer service (Nathan) again who this time said the order is held for 2 days and that it wouldn't be cancelled until then. Completely different information than what I was told before. Luckily he got it cancelled for me but I wasted a lot of time because of the first agent giving me the wrong info."

  "articleText": "I had an outstanding customer service experience at the Tukwila, WA store today. I waited my 20 plus minutes in line to return a comfort I had bought two days before that I had not opened and was the wrong color for my room. I picked it up in the clearance area and asked before I made my purchased if I could return it, and was told yes.  So I bought it.  The return department nicely advised me it was a final sale and I had been misinformed and they could not return it. I was not happy about it, but was resolved to accept my error and chalk it up to a $60 learning experience. That is when the employee conferred with her supervisor and advised me they would note in their system this would be a one time exception and returned it. Technically they did not have let me return the comforter but they did.  Thanks!!!"

  "articleText": "I placed an order on June 20th and scheduled the delivery for June 23rd which was one of the options Ikea was offering me. On the 22nd I got a text message and email rescheduling it to the 26th, on the 26th I was notified it was going to be rescheduled for the 28th. On the 27th evening I got a message confirming the delivery between 9am-1pm and on the 28th at 8am I got a new email rescheduling again for the 1st of July. All those days they scheduled I had to work from home what became a problem with my employer. This morning I called them to try to understand what was happening and they simply cannot do anything but ask me to wait because it will be delivered on Saturday, but if I want to cancel the order that's ok for them. Absolutely no respect with its clients. They charge 50 euros for delivery and that's what we get from them. Now I need the items, if I order with a competitor it might take another 10 days to get it. So I just have to sit and wait to their goodwill in delivering my stuff that is even already paid. I called their customer service and all I was told is it will be delivered on Saturday and there is nothing else we can do. If you want to cancel your order that's ok with us. Zero Customer Service quality!"

  "articleTitle": "Unbelievably bad experience",
  "articleText": "I had an unbelievably bad experience with IKEA. I made an order a couple of weeks ago for a total value of roughly $3'000, and paid the additional fee for the In-home delivery scheduling June 30th as delivery date. The reason why I selected June 30th is that I'm currently in Italy and will be landing in NY on that day, so I can't be home to accept deliveries any day before that and my building is not able to accept deliveries on my behalf.Unfortunately, though, two days ago I got an email from IKEA saying that I would receive part of the order on June 28th and part on July 3rd. I thus immediately called customer service (despite currently being in Italy and having to pay extra for overseas calls), and was told that the part scheduled for July 3rd was brought back to June 30th as I had requested, and the part scheduled for June 28th was managed by FedEx and could be changed only after I got an email from FedEx, and that I would have had to call again IKEA after I got this FedEx email. So, yesterday I called IKEA again, right after receiving the FedEx email, and was assured that they had informed FedEx that the package should be delivered June 30th. Today I woke up to another FedEx email that confirms that the package is on its way and confirmed to be delivered today, June 28th.Now, I honestly don't know who's to blame here, but what I'm getting from IKEA is an enormous sense of incompetence and lack of care. I spent a ridiculous amount of time (taken from my holidays in Italy) on the phone with customer service or on the chat with IKEA agents, and that was still useless given the zero results I obtained."

  "articleTitle": "DON'T click and collect",
  "articleText": "Ikea's Dublin Carrickmines click-and-collect service is an absolute joke! We placed an order on Wednesday, booked collection for 12 noon on Friday, arrived at 12:15 and were told the order wouldn't be ready for collection until after 3pm. Utter disgrace! We had to pick up kids from school in Co Wexford at 2:30, so couldn't wait around in Carrickmines. We requested they deliver the items free of charge to make up for their delay but the earliest delivery was Monday. We had driven up in 2 cars from Gorey (an hour and a half wasted each way, for 2 people, €26 diesel and €29 in petrol) but were told by the online chat complaints team that no further compensation would be offered. I'd compare it to booking a table for lunch at 12, with the food prepaid, then turning up and being told \"sorry, we don't have your food or table ready for you, you can wait 3 hours, or we'll send you free takeout in 3 days' time instead\". Who in their right mind thinks this is decent customer service? The chat team also told me I \"should wait to be told when the order is ready for collection\", which is all well and good when you're living a 10-minute drive away, but not 2 counties and 1.5hrs away! My email confirmation clearly stated a 12 noon pickup when I paid for my items. The \"4-hour window\" they referenced seems to mean (to them!) that they can bring it to the pickup point anytime within those 4 hours, when any rational customer would understand a 4-hr window to mean that the purchases would be there at 12 noon and the customer would have 4 hours to collect them. Shocking service, shocking lack of compensation, shocking lack of acceptance of responsibility. I am still soooo angry about the fact that both my husband and I wasted 3 hours of our lives (1.5 up and 1.5 back), petrol and diesel and have nothing to show for it AND are getting our furniture 3 days late and IKEA think they have done nothing wrong and owe us nothing except a limp apology."

I asked for a refund instead, which they refused, because they stated I should have noticed their error right away, and called to correct it. When you call customer service, they don't answer the phone, though . . . . and their Chat function is kind of hard to find. Terrible website, terrible customer service, and the shoddy furniture is made in China. It's not the highly-customizable, affordable furniture I remember from childhood. You might as well buy stuff of of Wayfair or Target or whatever. At least there are so many Target or WalMart store fronts that you can easily return the shoddily-constructed item."

On the 7th day at 8 AM I receive a call from the courier to let me know that he's about to deliver my parcels, I thought that was right on time. However, few hours later he calls to tell me that they made a mistake and forgot to load my parcels into the van. Inconvenient of course, but mistakes happen and he told me he would come the next day and that was fine. The next day I waited until 4 PM when I received another call from the same guy telling me that my parcels were the only transport to my city and there was no point to come to my address just for me, but they will deliver the next day (again). 2 or 3 hours later I receive another call from IKEA informing me that there was an issue with the dispatch of my order and that I should expect it to arrive in another 6 days.I canceled the order and now I can only hope I'm getting my money back. Their customer service don't care to help you either.Complete garbage, my first and last order, that they couldn't even deliver. Will never in my life order from them again and everytime I meet someone who is considering buying even a single thing from IKEA, I will make sure they change their mind.There's better shops that sell good, quality furniture and actually offers good customer service, go find those shops and stay away from IKEA."

The second person I spoke to then informed me a refund couldn't be issued because I had apparently 'misused' the items and said that nothing could be done. I asked them why I wasn't informed of this sooner and they ignored the question until I pressed them on it and they eventually told me I was notified about this when I contacted them about a refund a month ago, which never happened. When I told them I had never contacted them before this, he angrily replied that I had just mentioned in this chat that I contacted them a month ago about a refund, but I pointed out that I never said this and in fact said I returned the items a month ago. They finally looked into the issue properly and issued a refund. It was clear from speaking to the person that they barely understood English and the customer service had been outsourced."

At the same time, IKEA asked me to complain to the inspection company if I wish further complaints.  I saw the review of the inspection company that IKEA provided on Trustpilot, and I really feel that I will not get any fair answers back from this company.  We really hate this kind of situation where we feel that things can be a long exhausting experience.

  "articleTitle": "This is not a complaint",
  "articleText": "This is not a complaint, but a review. I wanted to buy some kitchen utensils. I entered IKEA in Riga, Latvia. I was there for the first time. The first astonishment was the unnecessarily complicated configuration and entry-exit of the parking lot, where the designers are confused in their craftsmanship. Okay, I went into the store to look for the product I needed. An unpleasant surprise was that, in order to find the item, I was driven zigzag along some unnecessary long route like a ram. With a sore leg, I wandered a long way, but then I realized that I felt like I was in the Minotaur's labyrinth (ancient Greek mythology) and I didn't want to stay in this ram's lair, but there was no way out. The placement of the product is not transparent, and the sales concept is chasing the buyer along a certain trajectory in the hope that he will buy something - on the basis of impulsive action. I find such a concept humiliating. It should be noted that I didn't buy anything because I wanted to get out of this maze as soon as possible, and also with a firm commitment never to shop at IKEA under any circumstances, because I don't want to feel like a ram in a trap, driven where the seller wants, not where the buyer needs. I was at IKEA twice at the same time - the first and also the last. I went to the supermarket, where everything is transparent and easy to buy. I was informed that IKEA is a store for young people who are starting to arrange their lives, but the concept of au laidar surprised me very unpleasantly - it is a humiliation. I read reviews about IKEA - just sad!"

I now have to wait until 27th May for the replacements and 5th of June for collection! I am sick of people telling me that they are sorry, if IKEA truly was \"sorry\" they would 1) get replacements to you within a few days, 2) allow staff to call you back if you get disconnected, 3) give you the earliest delivery date available without trying to get away with some dates two or more weeks away!The only reason I have not asked for total refund is I can't afford to pay to have it cousom built."

  "articleTitle": "Cheap furniture with ZERO after sales help.",
  "articleText": "I used to love IKEA but I've had nothing but issues with them recently. I bought a Kitchen which arrived damaged in some parts and had to be returned. For whatever reason, they thought it was a good idea to permanently print the door serial number and product name directly on the inside of each kitchen door so, I have to look at this single every day. Whoever thought this was a good idea should have a word with themselves. The assembly instructions are infuriating to navigate. I'm a designer and I spent most of my time correcting how they should have communicated steps in my head. Besides all of this; there is ZERO after sales care to speak of. If you ask to speak with someone in Dublin directly - you're told no. If you call the English phone number for IKEA to ask a question; they don't have a clue what you're talking about. I finally got through to a manager from the Kitchen dept in Dublin and, besides generally speaking over me; she said that they're too busy to deal with after sales on an individual basis. IKEA make more than enough money to change this.Their Buyback and Resell programme is an absolute scam. I went to the Dublin branch on Saturday with over €1000 worth of BESTA furniture. The furniture has been through two house moves so, it had light scratching throughout. I did an online estimate through the IKEA website and should have received about €400 for everything. I had to arrange for a van to transport everything to the branch, only to be told that they wouldn't give me anything for any of it, because the units had screw holes in the sides. THIS IT LITERALLY HOW THE PIECES ASSEMBLE TO ONE ANOTHER. This is how the instructions state they be assembled. If resold altogether; no holes would be visible once assembled???? If this is actually the case, IKEA should not accept any BESTA combinations back, as this is how all BESTA furniture is assembled. At the very least, they could mention that items with screw holes cannot be accepted online, so customers like me don't waste their time going to trouble bringing furniture back. I had to leave €1000 worth of BESTA furniture behind to be 'recycled'. I do not believe for a second that this will actually happen. They gave me a pitiful 'waver' to sign which at no point stated that they will not sell the items I left to be 'recycled'. I have no doubt that they will sell these items on, without compensating me for it.I bought another unit while in the store on Saturday and brought it home. Not only have the prices gone up but the quality of the materials have also gone down. We put the base of the unit together and it felt so flimsy to handle. Like the slightest knock would cause serious damage. There are also a couple of flaws throughout that just shouldn't be there. I am dreading putting the doors on and if there's a single scratch on anything else, it will be going straight back."

Then we were directed to another part of the store where we were to pick up the product.  After another long wayward trek around the maze we finally found the furniture pickup area.  Here there were over 30 people waiting in line and a single harried employee trying her best.  If I could have canceled the order at that point, I would have but there was no place to do so.  The board on the wall said our order was ready but we were forcibly enjoined from going into the storeroom to get it ourselves.  So we had to wait a couple of hours before finally getting our purchase.  I will never darken their door again and I would caution anyone against doing so."

  "articleTitle": "Ikea Assembling - The Worst Experience Ever",
  "articleText": "Last April, I spent thousands of euros buying IKEA Items and expended extra money to assemble them by IKEA Team, thinking this would be the safest choice to avoid problems.The experience was completely the opposite.One of the assemblers was very good and polite, but the other was not professional at all. Beyond the fact that this assembler stepped in dog feces and walked all around the house, and didn't clean the floor (even after him what he had done), my neighbours asked why they were not invited to the Open House party (???) because they thought that the loud music during assembling was a party.Finally, they were oriented by their manager, who refused to assemble the BESTA TV Frame, informing them that it didn't have rails. To understand that, considering the project was made by the group team in the store, I went back to IKEA Delft in person to talk with the IKEA BESTA department, and they guaranteed me that the BESTA TV already had in the Kit four Ls to support for the hanging. The information was also in the BESTA TV Document!The customer service who attended to my complaint on the first floor confirmed the information.After six days, the department responsible for replying to the complaint in the store sent me an e-mail, asking how I cleared the dog feces, and I informed that I handle with it own myself.Beyond that and the worst part, apparently the team who answered the complaint probably consulted only the assembling company and said that it is not possible to hang the frame on the wall, but let's go deeper into this:1) The BESTA TV Frame DOCUMENTS show how you should hang it on the wall2) The BESTA Department in Delft Store CONFIRMED that it is possible to hang it on the walls because the BESTA TV Frame already have the items necessary for it in the Kit3) Two areas of the IKEA Delft Store CONFIRMED that the item could be hangTo finalize the e-mail they just sent the problem to me and said I should hire an assembler to do the work I had already paid for.After a week, because a new order for other assembling, even after postpone the new assembling they the finally decided to read the manual and hang the BESTA TV. Althoght, they blocked the energy socket, so I requested then to open hole in the back so I could reach the socket, but they informed that they couldn't do it and I should hire a handyman to open a hole in the back part of it, or I should do it by myself.After cutting myself trying t do it and after spent more than 7 thousand euros in the store for items and assembly, the minimum that I expected was RESPECT.So, let me summarize:1) Show minimum respect for your consumers2) Prepare and train your partners and customer service employees to be at least well-informed about your products3) You can hire teams that can spread feces in my house, but don’t put the hot potato in your customers hands otherwise no one will respect Ikea as a brand that they can trust on."

  "articleTitle": "Discrimination at Ikea Halifax",
  "articleText": "I am writing to express my deep disappointment and frustration with the unacceptable behavior of one of your customer service representatives at the Ikea Halifax store. I visited the store today morning at 10:40 am to return an item with the original receipt and the item in its original package. I had my credit card, which I used when I first purchased the item.However, the customer service representative, Cindy, who was conducting the transaction, treated me and my wife with discrimination because my wife was wearing a hijab veil. Cindy started the conversation by accusing me of returning the item before, even though I had the original receipt and the item number on the original package matched that on the receipt. When I explained that I had done a different return two days ago and showed her the return receipt, she asked to check my credit card physically, which was suspicious to me. This was the first time that a representative had wanted to hold my card to check it.When I asked Cindy what was wrong with the return and even suggested that she could still process the return even if my card had a different number, she became more aggressive and called me rude. She refused to proceed with the transaction and left the counter, leaving myself and my wife stranded.When I went to look for a manager on the floor, I could not find one. Eventually, someone named Conor showed up and introduced himself as the manager. However, when I asked to meet with the store manager or deputy, Conor told me that both were unavailable and refused to arrange a meeting.When I went back to the counter, I found that Cindy had returned and thrown the item back in my wife's face and refused to serve us, calling me rude again. Her coworkers, Valiyn and Courtney, and even Conor, refused to give us her name. When I insisted on speaking with a manager, Conor finally gave me her first name only after speaking with the Deputy Store Manager, Geraldine, who also refused to meet with us.I am deeply disappointed with the behavior of your employees, who not only discriminated against my wife but also insulted and disrespected me as a customer. I was appalled by the lack of management on the floor, the absence of titles on name tags, and the fact that your employees introduce themselves as managers when they are not. This behavior is completely unacceptable, and it is unacceptable for a customer to leave with their dignity on the floor.I demand an immediate and thorough investigation of this incident, including disciplinary action against Cindy and any other employees involved in this unacceptable behavior. I also demand a formal apology and compensation for the humiliation and distress caused to myself and my wife.I have received a complaint reference number (Ref# 2798284), which I have no idea what was written in it. I expect the after-sales manager to contact me promptly to discuss this matter and to take appropriate action.I hope that you will take this matter seriously and take the necessary steps to ensure that this type of behavior does not occur again in the future."

I bought a wardrobe and as usual, I was trying to assemble it with my boyfriend following all the instructions in the manual.At first, we felt the item lacked quality but we were oblivious considering we had always gotten stuff from IKEA.All the items felt weak and half way through assembly, the wardrobe snapped and fell on my foot.We tried to reach out to IKEA support, and after 8 days, their reply was that it is our problem and they cannot do anything about it.IKEA quality has deteriorated, and their support proved to be as bad as the quality. Never again!"

So as we looked at our trolley yes indeed part of our order had been put in the said yellow bag. So I asked \" why put them in this bag if you cannot leave the store with them \"...he didn't reply. So we emptied the bits and gave him the bag, before we could take one step he stopped us again \"where was our receipt for the goods ? So got it out he looked at it and said ok. I haven't used IKEA in over 10 years but must say we found this chap very confrontational and certainly clouded our original thoughts."

  "articleText": "We are from Louisiana. We don't have an IKEA warehouse here. We've been looking for a bed for our teenager and we liked FLEKKE with IKEA. Since we were planning our vacation in Florida, it was decided to go to the local IKEA at Jacksonville and purchase the bed. So we did. On arriving back home in Louisiana we found out that the box was damaged by a forklift together with the items inside (and the damages were masked/concealed from the outside, so it was impossible to see them in store). We called to replace two items - one was sent to us. Called again - another was sent. All this takes time, and we needed the bed to sleep on. On receiving the second replacement item we started to put together the bed. Unfortunately, we found out that one more part is also damaged. The Jacksonville store refused to supply us with the last damaged item, suggesting to bring the bed back (550 miles trip). We think the customer service for the international company could be much better if they think to establish a good business in the US. Suggest to never ever purchase any item unless you have a opportunity to come back and dump it in the store!"

  "articleText": "My daughter made the huge mistake of buying a Malm 6 Drawer “Particle Board” Dresser from IKEA.Big Mistake !!!!It’s amazing how this company has the nerve to charge over $400 for a dresser that’s made of 150% sawdust & glue that is pressed together.All my daughter did was simply close a drawer and a “particle cross board” snaps on her.When you assemble junk like this, make sure that your are satisfied where you put it because if you dare move it in the future, it will easily come apart and snap on you. Your beverage rings will also be well noticed too…..so lay a towel down 1st. (thats what sawdust will do.)I even went to IKEA’s website to get replacement parts. Their website is useless. You cannot order replacement particle boards.When the day finally comes to launch this junk out on your lawn, be sure to cover it up. If it gets wet, it will swell and become 50 times heavier and your garbage men will be mad at you.What happened to the good old days when furniture was made of this thing called “real wood”?If you are looking for a furniture sawdust & glue mill….IKEA is the perfect place to go !!!If you want to see what real wood furniture once looked like…..visit a history museum."

  "articleText": "Ikea Egypt is a very bad experience! I have ordered a book shelf from Ikea.eg, I have paid almost 17000 LE. I have scheduled the delivery for Thursday, but someone called me and said we can delivered two days earlier. I said no as nobody was at home. On Thursday (the planned delivery day), we have waited until 16:00 clock and no delivery, until we contacted IKEA via the chat option on IKEA.eg and informed the central delivery station. An unidentified car park in front of my home and three persons wearing normal cloths (Usually, they come with IKEA official wearing) bought and assembled the box. They have tried several time and failed. Again contacted IKEA chat, nothing happen. We refused to accept the box and did not sign the delivery notice (this was a wise decission). After several complaints, I have finally received a phone call with the customer service, who was convincing me to take the cabinet as it is with the defect (what a shame!). He also informed me that IKEA has an agreement with a subcontractor, who did this mistake. I told him it is none of my business, I ordered the stuff from IKEA, not a subcontractor. Thanks for the online Egyptian law, I told him come take your stuff as per online purchase law. Finally, they came and pick up the cabinet. Now started the session two of the story, when I bought the cabinet, they have charged my master card on the same moment. When it comes to refund, I never heard from them so far, It is almost one week. I send several Email and contacted IKEA via the chat option, every time, we will contact you within 48 hours, within one day and almost a week and nothing. No confirmation of a refund. As the story has no end, I have contacted my bank to take an action with them. Usually, IKEA is a very good store with a great service, but this time was horrible. This let me think twice, by next time I order anything from. Still hope that I will get my 17000 LE back!!!!!!"

I got in contact with Ikea and they initially seemed to be very helpful with the matter. I uploaded 4 images of the cracks and from that they decided that it was \"assessed by our specialists and no manufacturing fault identified and this was assessed as wear and tear\". This sink has only been installed for 5-6 years, minimally used as a dishwasher is used for any washing, and cannot be replaced by the same sink as it is discontinued and no other sinks will fit in its place so countertops, cabinets, taps all have to be replaced. I followed up enquiring how it was assessed by specialists through 4 images and what wear and tear equates to and what a 25 year guarantee actually covers however there was no follow up."

  "articleText": "NEVER shopping with IKEA ever again. Bought the wrong piece of furniture online by accident and needed to send it back. Ikea seemingly offers a pickup service to send back furniture and get refunded (*that they charge 39 euros for already). Organised a pick-up time for last week, for which they give a 4 hour window. I stayed home waiting patiently during the whole 4-hour window only to find out nobody showed up. So I had to organise *another* pickup time one week later, another 4 hour window I spend at home and by the phone. Again nobody shows up. The pick up service couldn't figure out how an interphone worked so decided to leave. I am not spending a 3rd day waiting like an idiot for this, IKEA should stop promising services it clearly cannot offer or maybe fire the geniuses it has hired for deliveries (who don't know how to ring a doorbell or use a phone). Customer service on the phone today was \"very sorry\" but couldn't offer any compensation for the trouble or any solution other than waiting again for this magical pickup service to maybe show up on another day. I guess that's a goodbye forever to IKEA furniture, shame since I've been shopping with them for 10 years."

I honestly think they’re just searching their website for keywords from my call, which I could do (and have done) on my own. And I’ve had zero luck getting to a manager.Good news is that the kitchen planner that I worked with was pretty good and about 90% of my order was available and I was able to find the remaining pieces.

I was extremely shocked and upset as everything was in stock!  i went onto the live chat and the guy was about as useful as a chocolate teapot he told e to cancel the order and re-order but i would wait for up to 10 days for a full refund! when i said this was right or good enough and i need this issue looked into as he agreed they was all in stock locally he said there was nothing he could do and couldn't look into it?! when i asked to speak to a manger he said i would have to call up and abruptly ended the chat! I have since tried to call spent hours on the phone and have yet to hear back from a manager whom I've been  told are the only ones that can assist in resolving the delivery time! this is a terrible service no body has a clue what's going on , no one seems to want to help or resolve any issues and over a 6 week waiting period for apparently 2 doors is ludicrous and extremely unrealistic especially when all items are in your local store in stock!"

The problem which I've had, IKEA sells the product(Friheten/Klagshamn skiftebo blue) but they say the part of items aren't available when the delivery time's arrived. I've bought sofa, £764, on 28.03.2023 and the estimated delivery time was 01.04.2023. (If I knew that you don't deliver it on time, I wouldn't buy it!) Then, I had a chat with customer service via website around 2 hrs because I believe that their system is so slow.. Customer service, Deepak, firstly told me the item isn't available, and they can produce and deliver it to me in 1 month. Of course I didn't accept it. We've started to discuss about it. Then, suddenly the item was available in Milton Keynes. I've confirmed and told them please send it to me immediately. Then, he asked me again when I should receive it. I've told him if you work on 7th April, please deliver it by 11am. He took 5-10 mins again to book it for me, but he told me that he can't see delivery slot! How come, it wasn't available again after 5 mins and Deepak told me that 'we'll refund missing items'. So? I have one part of the sofa, and the other part is missing. What's the point? Do I put this sofa to my living room as a half?? After 2 hrs discussion, I have nothing. I've offered IKEA to refund full, and deliver it to me asap, then if they send the missing part, they should charge me again. However, they didn't accept it. Deepak opened the case for me. Then, we finished the conversation after 2 hrs! Later on, I've checked IKEA website again and they still sell the same sofa which costs £764 for their customer. I have a video as a proof. It means that IKEA collects £764 from the customer but when it's the delivery time, they tell that the part of items are missing! it's a shame on you!"

  "articleText": "We ordered a Mattress on 30th Dec 2022 which was delivered on the 6th Jan but on inspection this was found to be damaged.  We contacted Customer Services by phone the same day and was promised a replacement to be delivered the following Friday 13th Jan, and this was confirmed by Email.We did not get confirmation of this delivery so phoned Customer Services on 12th Jan and was told it would be delivered as scheduled on the 13th Jan, it did not arrive. Phoned Customer Services again and was told it would be delivered on Sat 14th Jan again it did not arrive.We phoned Customer Services again and was given another delivery date for Fri 20th Jan and after phoning again to confirm this delivery it still did not arrive.After spending hours on the phone and receiving many apologies we still do not have the Mattress we ordered on the 30th Dec 2022 and therefor requested a full refund.After threating to charge IKIA for storing this mattress it was eventually collected on 02/02/23, and have received a refund for the cost of the mattress. What is still outstanding is the refund of the £40 delivery charge and compensation for all the stress IKIA has put us through."

  "articleText": "The worst online shopping experience ever. I just moved to Germany and made lots of purchases from IKEA by rental car within first days. Later on we wanted to complete other missing stuf with online shopping but I'd never do that again. They blame the strike in post but they are the only store who delayed my package. All other deliveries from other suppliers was on time. And only thing they can say is \"we ask your patience, we don't have more information to give\" they even don't know when they can deliver.I want to warn new expats or other online shopers, don't rely on dates provided in the checkout page. They don't know how important it would be orders in a new home. And their promise is to make you happy in your new home. Not at all.Update 2023-03-25: IKEA also refuses my order cancel request as it's shown in preparation phase in their order page. But still, they are not able to tell me when they will deliver them, maybe it will take months with this lack of foresight. Which means they tell me without shame that they seize my money until I receive the delivery and reject it. I have all chat records and will apply to consumer arbitration committee. Such a shameless awful service and disappointment.Update 2023-04-04: Package delivered last week which was 3 weeks later than the promised date and 5 later than the order date."

  "articleText": "I wanted to order furniture from IKEA for delivery to NYC.Problem 1:The delivery was split into three batches when trying to checkout. I was only able to select delivery dates for two of them. The third one was always scheduled for two or three days in the future. So I had to wait until the right day to order and to adapt the shopping cart since availability was different on the day of the order.Problem 2:On the day of scheduled delivery, not all items were delivered. I was on the phone with the hotline for 2 hrs. They said it's my problem and I would have to call the delivery company. The delivery company told me they could not pickup the items at the local IKEA store. I called the hotline again and they could not help me. They offered to either refund the missing items or they could reorder them and they would be arriving earliest one week later. However one item was not available and they could not tell me if it would be available again at all. They also said that I would have to pay for the delivery again. Even though it was not my fault that IKEA messed up the delivery. I was on the phone for another hour since I could not believe what I was offered.Problem 3:The next day I decided to go to the local store. They understood my complaint and since the one item that could not be delivered was not going to be restocked I chose a different item in the store. The item was oversold which was the reason that the delivery that included this item could not be delivered. The reason I went to the store was that the missing items included bed and sofa so I had nothing to sleep on. The IKEA employees in the store were helpful and processed my purchase and told me to get a same day delivery with lugg which would of course be reimbursed. I purchased the same day delivery in the store and the employee took all the information for generating my refund.After two weeks I still did not get a refund so I had to call the hotline again. They told me I would not get a refund. After another 20 minutes they stated the reason, that there would be a wrong amount on the lugg receipt. I should go to the store to clarify that.This is the worst customer service I ever experienced."

So I'll just give the review here:The LURÖY slatted bed base has a very poor design because these slats (that are incredibly flimsy) just lay on the bedframe and center piece once it's put together. They don't latch into place or anything, so it's very easy for them to move around, especially after your mattress is sat on them. They fell off the frame and onto the floor underneath my bed not a week into owning the bed. Useless!

IKEA hotline confirmed that the order will be delivered to my 3rd floor.Unfortunately, when IKEA delivery track arrived IKEA delivery staff said that they are very busy and they left everything on the ground floor. And there was rainy on this day.I am old and am not able to bring all these heavy boxes into my apartment on the 3rd floor.So I paid 130 euros to one of my neighbors to deliver all these boxes to my third floor. And he spent half of the day doing this. There was no other way to solve this problem created by IKEA staff.Last month I sent already 3 e-mails to the customer support of IKEA  with a request to return my money back to my bank account (because I paid for the delivery of these wardrobes to my apartment) and as a result, there are only their automatic answers \"We have received your email and will respond to your query within 24 hours\" and nothing more   :-).  They never replied to me. So my money was just stolen by IKEA.I was an IKEA client for many years and now I am very dissatisfied with the low level of service and customer support presented by IKEA. And, of course, stealing the money of clients is absolutely terrible story for the reputation of the company."

I told them twice by email that I was on disability (back problem) and could not drive and go into a store. I have had no response from them. This is shameful on two counts: not taking responsibility for mistakes and responsibilities. Not caring about the difficulties of people with disabilities. I would like to point out that I got a 1st gift card for the error on the 1st delivery (legs missing), but that has nothing to do with the fact that they promised me a new delivery with the missing part (I have all the chat conversion excerpts in screen prints)."

Despite contacting customer service at least 10 times over the course of 2 months, I was still told that my sofa bed was not covered by warranty, and they would not offer any compensation or discount coupons.

  "articleText": "I ordered several items as gifts for a family member. I chose to have the items delivered. When the delivery arrived, only some of the items were included. (and one thing I did not order was included). I called customer service, I waited 45 minutes to speak to someone, they took down the information and promised to call back in 72 hours. they never called back. it is now 7 days after i first reported the missing items. after chatting with customer support, I have been informed that it may take another 3-4 days to \"investigate\" the issue before a replacement can be shipped. further, the agent refused to refund the delivery fee despite not having anything delivered on time and not having a resolution or even a timeline for the resolution. it is taking ikea longer to \"investigate\" their mistake than it took them to ship me the mistake in the first place. The customer service response for an alarmingly simple matter is totally embarassing for an orginization of your size. Does it really take 15 days to figure out if you screwed up shipping items worth $40?! Amazon would have replaced and shipped new iteams by now. Target would have immediately rectified the issue and refunded the delivery fee."

Most of the stuff is just fancy and overpriced. They even rip of on some articles charging 1000% more when you don't have a members card.In store experience is also very bad. You get the employees almost screaming at you. If you order food, they just throw it on a plate like in prison. Also the drinks are really bad. Almost everything is in plastic. The self serving area is like designed to keep you walking more than chilling and eating. The tables aren't stable. The illumination is bad. Actually in the whole warehouse the illumination is close to a depot. There also is a lot of broken stuff in the shelves. Broken lamps... Etc.This store is literally a store for poor people who like to scroll TikTok all day. Ikea is like scrolling.Ohh look a chair.What's next. Ohh What The Heck 😒 they even sell seafood.Poor people definitely will buy stuff they don't need. And that's why I call.AVOID! Even the coffee is a rip off and tastes terrible.Buy quality. And only things that you really want or need."

Once payment had been made they decided to tell us that half the things we'd planned and paid for were out of stock with no information as to when they might be available. Unfortunately we lost the will to carry on and cancelled the whole thing. We are now fighting to get a refund from them which is also proving to be harder than you'd think"

There was a kitchen fitted to the wall previously, I enclose a photo of this.There are 200 houses on my urbanization of Mosa Trajectum, all of which have fitted kitchens, including IKEA kitchens.I am now without a kitchen and I am unable to arrange an alternative kitchen fitter for many weeks causing so much inconvenience.I request that you provide a competent alternative kitchen fitter as a matter of the utmost urgency.I am very annoyed and extremely disappointed by my first experience using IKEA.I await your rapid response.Keith Postlethwaite"

When I tried to ask a question, she made weird faces, rolled her eyes at us, like she couldn't understand what we were saying. And when I tried to explain to her, she told me: \" You don't have to act smart with me, do you get it ?\" I mean, I was shocked and got immediately upset. Then while giving us our bill back, she said \"Thank you\" and \"welcome\" to me, as if she was trying to teach manners to us.Our overall experience could have been better, and it was my first IKEA visit."

I called the customer service, but it was an automated circle and you could not get anyone on the phone.. I tried it several times and they always leaded you back to the beginning. I could only reach someone with putting in wrong information. Then the woman told me there is something wrong with my order and she does not unterstand it, but they will call me back soon and clarify. Today is the 8. February and still no answer, no email, no call. I called again. Again a woman and she told me something is wrong and you will here from us. I asked if I can get the number of the specific Ikea to call and ask, but no, thats not possible.It is a joke. Ikea is such a famous company and the customer service is really a joke! I will never ever order anything again! You don´t know if you get the order, you can´t even get information and I have no idea if I get my money back.. I am super angry! IKEA THAT SUCKS!"

No explanation and no follow up call. The delivery men also smashed two light fittings in the hallway when delivering. I contacted IKEA to find out what was happening, to be told some items where out of stock but what was available would be delivered and a confirmation email sent. No email arrived and no delivery date confirmed. Contacted IKEA again waited 15 mins to be connected, and promptly the call was ended 2 mins into a conversation. Again no return call or email even though the caller took all of my details and order number. IKEA have my contact details but make no effort to contact me. Resorted to \"live chat\" guess what the message reads that no person is available to deal with my concerns please call the customer service number! What a joke. IKEA very happy to take my money when taking my order but want to try and disappear when they fail to deliver goods paid for. I will continue to beg for my goods, if they continue to fail, my only option will be Trading Standards! What a sad state of affairs, all I wanted was some bedroom furniture."

The day before, I received an email telling me that the product I had purchased was sold out, and therefore I could not pick it up. The reserved amount on my card did not get released until 30 days later when it was automatically cancelled. So I thought that maybe it would be easier to purchase this item and have it shipped. I made a new online purchase on Jan 24, 2023 and could not pick an earlier delivery date than Feb 2 between 17-21. Feb 2 comes and there's no delivery, nor any information or message from IKEA telling me the status of the delivery for the day. So I called them today, Feb 3 and found out that it would be delivered on Monday Feb 6 instead. As I spoke with the customer representative, I asked him what the point was to chose specific delivery date and time, if as he was stating, it was only a rough estimate. He couldn't answer me. When I asked if it's not normal to receive status updates on your order, he talked about something else. Couldn't really get through to him on how unsatisfactory my experience had been."

I was in the queue with my partner and the restaurant was super busy and there were two long queues of shoppers waiting to purchase food etc, apart from a couple behind us that is.A lady and man behind us decided that they didn’t want to wait in the queue as they were only buying tea and cakes, so the lady decided to approach a staff member and ask if he could give her two cakes which he did and they left the long queue behind them to get their drinks.What would happen if we all had that mentality to queue jump??Must admit I wasn’t happy, and complaining to staff would have made no difference"

Anyways I’m disappointed I did not get the money back I went to my family told them and we went to go talk to her but then the cafeteria closed.

That a total of 7 days to buy and erect a wardrobe. A massive dent in your environmental credentials and a massive dent in your credibility as an efficient retailer."

Looked at each individual item several times and each showed that it was available for delivery. Eventually in exasperation located a customer service phone number who explained that this message ('Some items are out of stock') actually means there are no deliveries available!!!!! STUPID OR WHAT!! I now have to try again as new delivery slots are brought in each morning, in the hope that no items go out of stock in the meantime. What a waste of my time - if it was down to me I would NEVER shop in Ikea again. This is far from the first time I have had issues with their lamentable systems. And they want to charge £40 for delivery....."

I was not contacted by a phone, email, noone buzzed (and I received another parcel today, buzzer works, and since I was at home I signed for it!). I am also not happy with the support I received on chat. I was advised to call Bring myself, which was unacceptable. I did everything according to the arrangement and Bring is a company that IKEA.dk choose to subcontract. Then this person wanted me to come back tomorrow in order to arrange a redelivery... also unacceptable. Also, the feedback function was disabled (the error said an invalid address!).

Having paid £50 for the express delivery (because the order size would never have gone in the car!), I'd say I'm disappointed on two counts:- Having worked from home specifically to take delivery, I was informed on the order confirmation email that I'd be called an hour before they were due to arrive. This didn't happen, and the delivery has caught me in the middle of a work meeting that I'd have otherwise moved/rearranged.- The service states that they'll take the delivery to any chosen room in the house, which whilst technically true, can only be done if the delivery team keep their shoes on. Considering we've got brand new carpets and don't really fancy crud being walked through them on a wet winter's day, I've asked the delivery team to slip them off before going upstairs, only to be told that is a Health & Safety breach. Guess what, I now have a fairly significant amount of furniture on the lounge floor that I'm going to have to move myself.Granted, these issues aren't exactly \"end of the World\" stuff, but frustrating nonetheless when paying for a delivery service that a lot of companies offer for free..."

  "articleText": "If it was possible I’ll give 0 star to IKEA. I bought some furniture online for my daughter who was moving to DC for her las College year. The page ask me when I wanted the delivery and if I wanted the assembly with their partner task rabbit, I thought that was wonderful, but guess what… my delivery never arrived and after talking to many people in customer service that were polite but didn’t have a clue on how to help o resolve issues, someone suggested that I should cancel the order and re-purchase at the store to get a next day delivery. So I did it, but guess what… when I went to the stand to schedule the next day delivery and assembly..,, they didn’t have the truck size I needed. Si at the end I had ti hire another company that charged me almost 2000 to make the delivery and assemble the furniture. So the cheap and low quality Ikea Products that I bought at the end cost me more than a regular store with more quality and better service."

  "articleText": "Ikea is the devil. They have no customer service and don't care about you at all. When I initially placed my order (thousands of $$ of kitchen cabinets for use in a medical office) I was told I would have everything in 2 weeks.Come delivery time 3 weeks after I place my order (and without notice), I only received part of my order. I call them and get the run around and was told the remainder of my order will be delivered in another week. Well, that remainder of the order was then split into 3 other shipments, then they call me saying I need to pay separate deliveries fees of $80 for each delivery!!I receive another delivery 2 weeks later, and still missing part of the order. Then after another 2 weeks I'm told the final part of my shipment will arrive.I post up in our new office and only 6 drawers get delivered. I still don't have the base of the cabinets. I call Ikea and they tell me they're on the truck and will be delivered that day. I wait and I wait, nothing.I call Ikea the next day, and they said the truck had mechanical problems. I called the contracted shipping company (Select Express) and they said they never received anything from Ikea's warehouse. I call Ikea back and got a different person who confirmed they didn't leave the warehouse yet. So they lied right to my face.Here I am 2 months after placing my order and still don't have the base cabinets. I have a new office to open up and can't cause it is filled with cabinet parts and boxes that I can't even begin to start assembling until I have the cabinet bases. Every day we're not open we lose $10k and Ikea doesn't care one bit. They got their money.Ohh by the way, I asked if I can just go to the local warehouse and pick up the items from there. They told me I would have to purchase them separately and send everything else that I received back for a refund + restocking fee because my initial order was from Ikea Business Division and not the local warehouse.Well never give Ikea another penny, and if anyone out there is thinking about ordering their cabinets from Ikea I would highly recommend you go elsewhere."

  "articleTitle": "\"Chiquitita tell me what's wrong\" - The Fallacious Nature of IKEA Customer Services",
  "articleText": "I purchased a double bed within the last *three months* and it has broke. Customer service employees are highly condescending and arrogant, with little to no empathy, and they seem void of any human emotion at all. I have read the 365 day return and exchange policy but was being told something completely different over the phone. It is almost as if they want to make it more difficult for you to resolve your issue in the hopes that you either give up and admit defeat (loss of over 400 pounds) or spend a painstakingly long amount of time on hold listening to ABBA tunes. I have been laughed at, ridiculed, hung up on and told false information by customer service employees just because they did not want me to take the matter any further. This is absolutely shocking form such a large company, but I guess I am the fool for deciding to build a bedframe from a company who use the most substandard materials there is. I chose IKEA as I am a uni student who cannot afford to buy anything from high-end competitors but now I will probably have to fork out some cash for a new bed (from somewhere else) so I am not sleeping on the floor whilst I wait *4-5 weeks* for a RESPONSE to my enquiry for an exchange or new parts.TL;DR- IKEA is a hit or miss, more like finding a needle in a haystack of misses. My advice is to not buy anything bigger than a small set of drawers as you are bound to be met with faults which means having to talk to the *awful* customer service reps. 400 pounds down the drain! Shame Shame Shame on you IKEA!!"

The store itself is also not as clean as it used to be - I saw dirty cutlery and cups in the restaurant. And the food at the restaurant isn't as good as it used to be either.I'd rather pay a little more and go somewhere else where the products are better and the customer service is good.

  "articleText": "Ordered a IKEA desk for Christmas gift for my partner on November 25th and scheduled the delivery for December 20th…plenty of time right? Well the 20th came and went with ZERO contact from North American Logistics. I call Ikea and they tell me that my desk arrived at the NAL warehouse on the 18th and there are no notes as to why it wasn’t delivered, so I instead reschedule for the 23rd. Okay no problem, at least it’s before Christmas right?! Welp, here I am on the 23rd with still zero contact from NAL (even though I’ve tried to call twice and each time I’m actually hung up on) and now my Christmas gift isn’t going to be delivered until the 27th. Maybe I’m dumb, but I’m pretty sure that’s after Christmas. Anyway, I cannot recommend a company that can’t delivery a parcel on time when it was ordered a month in advance. I am absolutely appalled at the lack of communication and will never order from IKEA again so long as NAL is in charge of delivery.UPDATE:They once again failed to deliver the package (12/27 due to a light dusting of snow) and wanted to reschedule for another week out (1/03). At this rate, we’re looking at a Christmas in July situation. I call IKEA support and some old hag who’s name I can’t remember, let’s call her Ethel, didn’t want to reimburse my delivery fee ($300) and basically said I was at the mercy of NAL. I informed her if she could just reimburse me for the delivery fee, I’ll wait until 1/03 for the table, makes sense to me considering the situation NAL has put their customer in. She then informed me that she’d rather cancel the order than give me the $300. In short Ethel costed her company a $200 sale on top of the $300 delivery fee they’ve already paid to NAL. Good job Ethel, Wayfair should hire you as a rep, cause I just got a $600 table from them thanks to you and your lack of deescalation skills… AND IT WILL STILL BE HERE BEFORE 1/3. Good luck to anyone ordering from IKEA I can’t recommend avoiding them or NAL enough, such terrible customer service and was completely devoid of any actual service. G’day NAL I hope you bankrupt yourself."

  "articleText": "I recently purchased a LAGKAPTEN / ALEX from the IKEA store in St. Louis, MO which is 2 hours from my home.   When we went to assemble it we noticed that we were missing an entire hardware kit for one of the cabinet units.  I contacted IKEA customer support, they said the only thing that i could do was drive the 2 hours back to the store and pick up the missing hardware kit which is very inconvienient, or they could order the parts and have them shipped which would take 7 to 10 days because the parts would come from the factory overseas, also inconvienient as I bought this item as a Christmas gift.  Customer service when I asked them to connect me to the store to see if the store could ship the parts I needed which would have taken less time I was told they didn't have direct contact with the local store.  So after going round and round I decided to let them ship me the parts from the factory.  Here it is 7 to 10 days later I receive the package with said parts and low and behold I am still missing 18 pieces of the needed hardware to assemble this product.  Now I'm beyond pissed which leads me to have a bad taste in my mouth for IKEA, IF I EVER DECIDE TO BUY ANOTHER THING FROM IKEA I WILL MAKE SURE TO UNPACK THE THING IN THE STORE BEFORE IT COMES HOME TO MAKE SURE ALL THE PARTS ARE IN THE BOX.  POOR QUALITY CONTROL ON IKEAS PART AND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WASN'T MUCH HELLP EITHER.  IKEA YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED  LISTEN TO YOUR CUSTOMERS AND DO BETTER TO FIX THEIR ISSUES IN A TIMELY MANNER 7 TO 10 DAYS IS NOT A TIMELY MANNER ."

  "articleText": "I will tell everyone I know and anyone that will listen that IKEA is too lazy and set in their ways to help a customer not to mention that IKEA trains staff to lie to try to make the business look better.I placed an order on 12/19 at about 7pm for a $200 gift card for my nephew. We then surprisingly received $30 in gift cards as part of their promotion. We decided that if we were going to get gift cards that we would buy my nephew a little something to go with the gift card. After much searching online, we found something that we thought would be perfect to use the $30. We placed the order at about 8:30pm. We then get an email notifying me of the scheduled time slot for pick up that I had no say in. We will be able to drive to Grand Prairie but not at their chosen time. I go ahead and drive there at and arrive at about 10:45. Upon our arrival, I am told by an employee that has the time to walk out to my car and talk about it that they are short handed and can not do it because it is not ready. I decided to go in and help with their short handedness by grabbing the items myself and taking them to the customer returns desk. At which time I am told once again that they are short handed and that I had to stick to their chosen schedule and that we cannot use the items that we brought (exact match) to complete our online request. After going round and round with her and the \"manager\" she contacted that came to the counter, we are told that it is just their policy and that they are not willing to work with customers. The customer would have to cancel the online order, thus requesting a refund which will take 1-3 business days, and make a new purchase by going through the normal check out. I am given similar disservice when I called the 888 number that the manager provided. What kind of customer service is this? Is it let's lie about why we don't allow customers to come at different times (short handed) until they call us out on it thus changing our story (based on assigned scheduled times)? Is it our schedule over customer needs? Don't even get me started on how many employees I saw standing around doing nothing, talking to other employees, or playing on their phones while I was navigating the store that I am sure has at least 100 signs in order to direct customers to the different areas. That's a great way to add salt in the wound of your customers as you lie to their faces with the same rehearsed story of being short handed. I've never encountered a business with such poor customer service and a lazy attitude! I would recommend that everyone in your leadership read Moments of Magic Be a Star With Your Customers and Keep Them Forever. Perhaps then you may take a look at some of the policies that lost you this first time customer and earned you many a bad review. I will NEVER shop IKEA again and I will never gift or buy new or pre-used IKEA products. I will tell everyone I know and anyone that will listen that IKEA is too lazy and set in their ways to help a customer not to mention that IKEA trains staff to lie to try to make the business look better. I have already processed a request to cancel the $200 gift card for my nephew and I am ready to dispute it with my credit card company. I have no desire to have monetary compensation for this ridiculous event. My hope is that someone actually reads this and acts upon it."

  "articleText": "Your online experience is absolutely shocking... ordered bed frame with headboard, mattress to go with it and a jug my wife wanted. Paid 40 pound for delivery and received mattress, headboard and jug. So ultimately I could use a jug at a cost of 40 pounds delivery.Speaking to customer service they are unable to transfer shipment from one shop to another to avoid cancellations instead automatically cancel the missing item and processing refund. I have been refunded for bed frame not delivered, but had to re-order and pay 40 pounds delivery fee again - this seems like a money grabbing scheme and easy money you make off people. Absolute shame - you should learn from companies like Amazon how to treat you customers and their money. Pathetic.I like IKEA, really do, but this is and absolute disgraceful experience especially in current cost of living situation and just before Christmas. Shame on you IKEA and hope you will have enough details here to really make things better..."

I mentioned it before. Sales Manager had no empathy or interest in selling me the product selected by me, I had to ask her to accompany me to the place of a lamp that I needed and she told me that she could not move from her workplace, then I asked her to she helped me with a desk and she told me to go back to the place and then give her the photo of what I was interested in, I did it and I returned with her, I asked several questions because I was interested in acquiring several Products but she did not show any interest, then she I asked to apply for an IKEA Credit card so I could buy more products but she refused, saying that I had to buy more than 500 dollars to apply.  If Sandra O's customer service would have been correct, I would have bought more products, but I think it was not the right service, I only bought a desk and a lamp, perhaps my purchase would have been better if my day had been with another Agent SalesThanks for you timeYalena"

  "articleTitle": "Don't bother ordering from the online website... Go in-store instead!",
  "articleText": "Ordered a few large items (200cm tall) with express delivery as my old MALM drawers broke and needed to store my stuff as soon as possible. I was decorating my room so I had about a week wriggle room until all the stuff needed to come.The delivery came next day but by look of the back of the van, the boxes had been thrown in. When the delivery men were taking the box's out, they landed every single box straight into mud whilst the corner of the boxes were damaged therefore damaging the items even further...I refused delivery as it was an expensive order and they told me I had to send everything back (even the stuff that wasn't damaged) so I did.I was later told my IKEA that I could've sent just the damaged item back...I then called IKEA to explain what had happened to get a replacement sent out but the delivery men hadn't put down that the items were returned to sender so I needed to wait until they received confirmation.Fine... So I waiting another day and called back up. They issued me a replacement and said it would be here the latest Thursday. I said this was fine as I needed them by Friday the latest (having ordered on the Sunday before).Wednesday night, I get a text saying \"Your order will be delivered between 7am - 11pm\". The next day I don't get a tracking link like I did previously and the order didn't arrive.I called up IKEA once again and asked if it was definitely arriving today, they said \"There's been a delay, it will be there between 4pm and 7pm\". I said okay and waited...5:30pm on Thursday... Still no tracking link so I highly doubted it would arrive. I called again and they said it wasn't loaded on to the delivery van so the earliest they could get it to me was Saturday, nearly a week after my initial order.So I asked IKEA to cancel the order and I'll just go pick it up myself (I noticed they missed off a few shelves on the replacement anyway!). This is obviously a huge inconvenience as IKEA is a 40 minute drive away...They said it was cancelled and I'd receive my refund in 14 days.A week later, I randomly get a text saying \"Your items will be collected tomorrow between 7am - 11pm\". So I called up again and told them I don't have any items as they were returned back to IKEA and no replacement items were sent. They assured me it was just a mistake and it was probably sent to the wrong number.The next day I get a phone call from the delivery company asking if I needed any items collecting as they could see my initial delivery was refused. I said no, I do not need a collection as I don't have any items.11am that day, the delivery company still arrives and I tell them I have no items and sorry their time was wasted! Even though it wasn't my fault...Fast forward to 2 weeks after my cancellation, no sign of a refund...So I patiently call the IKEA customer service team once again and ask if they can please issue the refund. I was apologised to and told it would be in my bank no later than Monday the 12th Dec.Now Tuesday 13th Dec, I still have no refund, £300 right near Christmas, after having to spend a further £300 to get my items in-store and my original order was placed on 20th November.I'm tired of having the call the IKEA CS team over and over again and absolutely nothing being done.I do not recommend ordering from their online store and god forbid you have any issues, good luck!"

God forbid you throw in a few extra screws! We call you \"support\" team again to complain and she's as useless as a bag of rocks. Why is she even taking calls if her system is \"down\"? In the middle of the call she called us disrespectful and hung up on us instead of doing her damn job of trying to help us. This has been a on going nightmare for us, and no one f*+king cares. We do finally talk to someone who can help they tell us the screws we'll be delivered within 10 days. Why is it that I'm able to order an entire bed with missing and damged pieces but the small the item is the longer it takes to be delivered??? WHAT THE ACTUALLY F*#K??  THIS F*&KING BED THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO TAKE NO MORE THAN AN AFTERNOON TO PUT TOGETHER IS NOW TAKING THREE WEEKS!! F*$K YOU!"

  "articleText": "Still waiting on the phone 48 minutes later. Delivery to the value over 2,500 euro arrived today to our business address without several items. No phone call from Ikea to say items were missing and no delivery docket issued. Nearest date for missing items is 13th December. They have left me waiting this long without resolving or apologising once for this big inconvenience. What a total joke. The representative, I think Jaret?? will not give me the names of the senior staff he claims to have spoken to, to resolve this issue or try to accommodate an earlier delivery date. I have asked for a copy of the recording and it will take up to 30 days to receive this. DON'T SHOP WITH IKEA, the customer care is so dreadful I have vowed not to shop there again."

  "articleText": "Ikea designed my kitchen two month ago and I am still waiting for it. The person who designed the kitchen was awesome. She recommended me to apply for the Ikea Project Card to pay my kitchen in two years without interest so I did it. I receive the Ikeas card 3 weeks after my application. I went back to Ikea to finalize the purchase. When I showed the credit card to the person helping me with the design, she said \"that is not the Ikea Project Card, that is the credit card and if you pay with it they will charge you interest\" She ask me to apply again and I did. Another three weeks went by and didn't received the card yet  so I decided to call the Ikea credit card customer service. They told me that I could buy my kitchen with the credit card they send me without interest and that the person in Ikea gave me the wrong information.I wish all the employees in Ikea had the right information because this is very frustrated. I am living in my condo now for 3 weeks without a kitchen just because the Ikea employees don't know the correct information. I am just more than upset because of this situation. I hope someone in Ikea can contact  me an find an immediate solution for me since they are the ones wasting my time."

There's no physical store near me so I had to get my item shipped to me, I expected the shipping to beat little costly because I ordered a bookcase but $300 shipping is outta control. I dealt with it because I really wanted the item so I set up the day I wanted to receive it which the closest date was a month out, the day it was supposed to arrive it didn't. I received a text to confirm my delivery date for a week from the day it was supposed to arrive so now I have to reschedule my time to be able to receive my order. Here we are today, with a delivery time of 1:30 to 4:30 pm. Item still hasn't arrived, after talking to an Ikea representative they offered a $20 Refund... TWENTY DOLLARS!!!!!  Do your self a favor and don't shop with them because they obviously don't have any kind of integrity.... Ikea, you might as well shut the company down until you can figure out how to do business properly"

  "articleTitle": "MIXED THOUGHTS +/-",
  "articleText": "My thoughts about IKEA are mixed. A combination of very negative aspects and very positive ones, made me decide to give 3 stars. I'm somewhere in the middle of being satisfied and disappointed as a customer.Negative:- EXTREMELY bad product availability especially about PAX wardrobes. They discontinued the black frames for PAX sliding doors and I've been waiting for the new model in a loooooong time. Wouldn't it be better if they discontinue something when the replacement is ready to be available?- EXTREMELY long waiting when you call for help (always AT LEAST half an hour and up).- The employees at the phone customer service are very polite and cute but it seems to me that they are not competent. From the 5 or 6 times that I had to call them, only once I got to talk to someone who had actual answers. All the rest didn't know about this, had no idea about that, they weren't sure about the other, and so on..I do not blame them though. I believe that it's a problem of leadership from IKEA's high ranked employees/partners. How can a phone customer service employee answer your questions if they don't give THEM first the information?Example: \"When are the new dark coloured PAX panels gonna be released?\". No one ever knew..- IKEA partners with Bring for product deliveries to homes, which is a really unreliable and full of hassle company (based on my personal experience and the dozens of bad reviews here on Trustpilot).- The PAX wardrobe designing tool would get stuck and reset, resulting in losing all of my editing and going back to the beginning. Tested both on phone and laptop.- The quality of most of their products is a joke but that's nothing new..- Quite expensive delivery but I'm soft about that because IKEA's main concept is \"you get it by yourself, you build it by yourself, it's therefore cheaper\".- The website is slow and often problematic.- An utterly exhausting experience to stroll around the physical store since one has to walk through the whoooooole thing in order to reach to what they're looking for.- Parts from the interior of PAX wardrobes are not discontinued but never back in stock. One plans for a wardrobe as he dreamed of it and then has to change way many things and compromise due to problematic availability.Positive:- Relatively affordable prices for the average hard working person who still doesn't earn much, the student and any other customer on a low budget. It gives chance to people to furnish their homes that they could not otherwise have.- Some really nice designs in both furniture and interior accessories.- Tasty food at their restaurant and I also love their simple ice cream.- One can book a cost free video appointment to get advice and help about the planing of a PAX wardrobe, a bed, kitchen renovation etc. I found it helpful.- Decent approach to a customer's complaint. I had problem with Bring who didn't deliver my order on time and the day was wasted. Then I was told that I had to wait for weeks before I could receive it! IKEA, expressing their regret for the inconvenience, managed to shortened the waiting time to one week and most impressively, compensated me with the full amount of the shipping cost (1999 kr). VERY APPRECIATED INDEED.- Smaller convenience (but if you think about it quite important): you can store your bags in a box with a key so you don't carry them around and have weight on your back or hands.- I haven't personally used it for my child but I give a plus for the existing playground so that the child/children don't have to tolerate the boredom of shopping and the parent/parents can shop without distractions.- Lovely furniture presentations at the physical store and some good inspiration online. Kudos to their decorators.All in all, I think that IKEA's results are a combination of talented designers and decorators as well as polite customer service employees and a team of people not competent enough in leadership and time & stock management."

Apparently they offered members a coupon every certain period of time to spend $150+ and get a $25 off. $25 wasn't taken off with one amount but splited applied to each single items with certain ratio, so when you return stuff you just basically lost that portion of discounted off no matter if your total bill was still over $150 without the return item. And they won't do anything or any adjustment for you in this case. I literally can just return the whole order and go back to buy the exact same thing to apply the coupon again!

  "articleTitle": "UNACCEPTABLE IKEA",
  "articleText": "This was unacceptable!14 attempts with your Customer Service team to organise what should of been a simple replacement of two damaged side panels.For over 20 years we have been shopping with IKEA, purchasing many items. In the unlikely situation that there has been a problem, Ikea has always resolved the issue swiftly.We visited the Wembley store on Saturday 5th November and purchased various items including two IDANAS units. We put the first one together with no problems but unfortunately when it came to the second unit we were unable to build it due to these damaged panels.We called customer services,  waiting 40 minutes to finally speak to Aaron at 1pm on Monday the 7th November. He was very apologetic and assured us the replacement panels would come from Reading as this was the nearest store with stock.  We did not get confirmation of this but trusted all would be well.After not receiving any emails from Ikea or Parcel Force, I rang customer services on Thursday the 10th November waiting 30 minutes until 12.15 when I spoke with Sebastian who again was very apologetic and informed me that the order had been \"stuck in the system \". She called the duty manager at Reading to authorise the order and said it would be picked on Friday the 11th and requested for it to be delivered on Monday the14th November.  I asked for email confirmation of this which she kindly did.Monday arrived and no delivery and no communication from either Ikea or Parcel Force.I called customer service on that Monday the 14th, waiting 30 minutes before speaking with Rachel at 12.40pm who was very short in her manner, not allowing me to finnish a sentence. I was trying to explain that we were expecting a delivery on that day and that we had heard nothing. Her response was to blame the other agent and that she had given us the wrong information! The parts had not even been picked yet and now they were coming from Wembley and would take 7 days to be delivered after being picked.when I asked to speak to a Manager, her response was that they would not be able to help. I asked again to speak with a Manager and was told it would be 72 hours and they would only call if they could help, which they couldn't.This was extremely disappointing to hear as there was most definitely a problem that needed to be resolved.On the 17th November I called customer services and spoke with Sebastian at 9.15am as no communication from Ikea or Parcel Force. Sebastian was as baffled as me. she informed me that the parts had not been collected and that Wembley didn't even have stock.Yet again we were waiting for a delivery that would never arrive!She booked it with Croydon.After not receiving any communication from Parcel Force again i called customer services and spoke with Josh Also on the 17th November at 5.53pm waiting about 20 minutes.I just needed a clarification it was picked and Parcel Force had it and also wanted an email address i could send a complaint to as the one supplied by Sebastian was not working. He asked me to send the email to him and he would forward it on.I called after hearing nothing on Monday the 21st of November and spoke with Rida at 12.29pm after a 30 minute wait.She informed me it was picked and Parcel Force would deliver that day. She confirmed this in an email to me.After no delivery I called the customer service team on the 22nd November and spoke with Muhammad at 9.45am after a 25 minute wait and he informed me Parcel Force now had the panels and it would take up to 4 days. I asked to speak with a Manager but he was unable to do this. He did however say he would forward it to his manager.  I asked if the Manager would contact me and for a email of our conversation.I waited until the 25th of November and this time my girlfriend called andspoke with 2 different  Customer service agents as the first Nabil dropped the call after 30 minutes,  didn't call back.  The second Shake basically said there was nothing she could do without pictures!I then called and spoke with Remi and after 30 minutes the call dropped, he never called back. Then I spoke with Darren. He informed me that the order was stuck in the system.  Seriously nearly 4 weeks.. I had to ask him to call Wembley Ikea and check stock and that I would go there myself. After a total of nearly 3 more hours ( 8 hours in total) I got permission to go and pick up the replacements for the damaged pannels myself!At no point did a Manager want to resolve this situation,  or was there any way I could escalate this.It was a totally unacceptable and avoidable situation."

After two weeks with no contact I called ikeas appalling customer service that they would gladly rearrange the delivery but I would be charged the delivery charge again despite having no choice in delivery tîe and no option to halt it. I was subsequently given incorrect information and just a generally infuriating experience from a rude agent who was intent on sharing details of IKEA s process. He could not escalate the problem, he could not email a form, he refused to escalate the call telling me he would decide what needed to be escalated and on. Never ever again they are cheap and now you know why. Certainly the worst customer service. So in the end I still don’t have my likely cheap and nasty product, I have written an email to the only email address you can find on their website and anticipate no response.

  "articleTitle": "Problems with quality, ordering, delivery and customer service",
  "articleText": "I wanted to write something a couple of months ago, but unfortunately my list of issues with Ikea just keeps increasing. We've spent €€€€ on Ikea furniture since September and had a staggering number of issues with ordering, delivery, product quality and customer support:- The iOS app has a permanent error message at the top and it is frequently unable to load my order history- We spent €1000 on a PAX unit and were told the day before delivery that two drawers were indefinitely out of stock, despite the fact that we designed the unit specifically with items that were in stock. After the out of stock message, there was no option to choose alternative items - just a take it or leave it option.- If you choose the option to have the missing items delivered later, it's converted into a separate order which is not added to your account, has no ability to track the status, and for which you will receive no automatic updates.- The above items are now available in-store for new customers but still not shipping to those who have already paid.- Most of the furniture we did receive was filthy inside the boxes. Not on the outside, literally inside. Covered in dust and in some places dirt that needed to be scrubbed off: PAX, Besta, Kallax and Lommarp units. €€€€ and you have to clean it all first.- Our Lommarp unit came with the wrong wooden parts (one was duplicated), meaning we couldn't assemble it. The entire unit needed to be replaced and we waited over a week for a collection and replacement.- Many Ikea items have stickers that don't come off easily. They crumble and leave glue residue underneath them. This means you need to spend time peeling them off in pieces and then googling how to clean glue off before spending time scrubbing.- Many parts have cosmetic issues in places: scratches, crumbling paint and in the case of our Vimle sofa, burns around one of the holes that made it extremely difficult to attach the bolts.- The functional design from product to product is inconsistent. Some units have adapters for skirting boards (Besta) and some don't (PAX). The adapters are, however, poorly designed because even at their smallest size, they're too big for many skirting boards.- The delivery tracking links don't work on mobile, which is terrible when you're expecting a 7am delivery. You should be able to check the link from bed, but instead need to use a laptop or desktop computer.- Some tracking links don't work on any devices because the URLs are broken. Since none of their tracking links are available in the apps, there is nowhere else to check. So a delivery window from 7am-2pm is a complete lottery.- The delivery is unreliable as the delivery windows aren't always respected by the logistics companies. They show up outside of the delivery/collection window without calling beforehand. In our case we weren't home, and had planned our day around the collection window.- The delivery company is supposed to phone an hour beforehand, which never happens. In some instances we received less than 10 minutes notice.- Important information is sent by email by customer support but there is never the option to reply to them.- The chat button on their website doesn't work at all on Safari on macOS- The chat tool often disconnects and you need to start completely from scratch, sometimes after 20+ minutes of chatting.- You cannot upload images to the chat tool, meaning if you're reporting a fault or damaged parts, you need to try to describe it rather than simply sending a photo- They will collect unwanted items within 14 days, but this isn't mentioned anywhere when filling out the returns forms. We missed it and had to pay for a 3rd party.I regret using Ikea and given the chance to buy this much furniture again, I would buy everything elsewhere."

  "articleTitle": "Worst Delivery Service",
  "articleText": "This is regarding the abysmal delivery service on an online order, with delivery booked for 5:00 to 9:00 PM, Friday November 11.Our apartment building requires us to book the service elevator for deliveries like this due to the size of the parcels and the potential for damage inside the elevators. I had booked it for 6:00 to 9:00 PM accordingly.At 8:07 AM, I received a text from the delivery movers saying: \"Hey its your ikea delivery for today,i was wondering if someone can be at the delivery address around 10-11we will be in your area around that if you can be there it will save us alot of time, if so it will be very appreciated Thanx for your time .please reply to confirm.st josesph\".No one was going to be available from 10-11 AM because my partner and I were at work. We had booked the 5-9PM slot because that is when we were available to be home to receive the delivery. I did not see this message until around 10:30 AM. This was the only message received from the delivery contractors that day.My partner and I received a call from our building's concierge at 10:20 AM letting us know that some IKEA delivery contractors showed up with all the packages and told him that I gave them permission to come at that time to do the delivery. I absolutely had not given permission. They proceeded to come up to our floor and dump all the parcels in the apartment hallway outside our unit.This was not our first IKEA delivery, we knew that the delivery movers often come outside of the given window. But this was a 7 whole hours outside the booked delivery window. This was absurd.The movers did not use the service elevator, which is padded and inspected before and after moves, which meant that we, as the registered unit tenants would be liable for any damages that may have happened (more likely in the smaller, unpadded elevators). The big parcels blocking up the hallway were also fire hazards, which we could have been fined for had our building concierge not informed us immediately. My partner and I had to rush home from work to move the packages inside.Every part of this experience was infuriating and not what I expect from an IKEA furniture delivery.I reached out to customer service on their website but the only options were to call in or chat with a bot. I hate this trend of corporations being greedy and cheap by trying to force you to talk to a useless bot instead of an actual person via email. They refused to refund the delivery fee ($60) because \"the service already happened\" and upon pressing further, offered a $50 IKEA gift card which I refused. What an absolutely horrible customer service policies and experience."

  "articleTitle": "Never Buying IKEA Again",
  "articleText": "This is the first time I've ever ordered from IKEA and it will most certainly be the last. I ordered a sectional couch and the night before it was scheduled to arrive, I received an email that said half of it was out of stock. I was refunded for the out of stock piece, but the other half of the couch was still sent. What am I supposed to do with half of a couch? Why send it at all? My wife and I spent over 2 hours putting together the half that arrived before realizing that something was wrong. This is when I checked my email and saw what had been sent the night prior. I then called customer service for a refund and to have the useless half couch picked up. I was told to take all of the pieces apart that we had spent hours putting together and to try to get it back into the boxes. Everything took up so much space in my house that it prevented me from ordering another couch from a more reputable company. It took days before someone finally came and picked everything up. Once they did, I thought the saga was over until a month later I discovered that I had STILL not been refunded for the useless half couch that should never have been sent in the first place. I called customer service once again to inquire about my refund and was told the systems were down and to try again later. The next day I called again and was told that I could finally expect my refund in 5-10 business days. Well, today I checked my credit card statement and it appears while I was refunded a portion, I am still missing over $250 dollars. I just had to call customer service AGAIN to ask where the rest of my money is and they have been unable to figure it out. They had to open up a case to have it looked into. Who knows when that will be? At this point I've paid IKEA a few hundred dollars for doing nothing except wasting my time. While I continue waiting for this to be handled properly, I'm letting everyone I know to NEVER buy from IKEA."

The reschedule for delivery isnt updated accordingly as per requested, and when i tried to get help from their customer service different agents gave me completely different answers. Also their partner delivery company, misinformed and claimed on MY authorization for early delivery. I did not know about any delivery occur until my new building management called me, and I had to go and pick everything up. The state of item being left at the door was horrible, they left everything block the entrance and neighboor hallway, one box is damaged and open I still did not have time to check if anything missing. Resolution department agent was not helpful as they work remotely and cant even transfer your call. My order was around $1300 worth but they offered to refund the delivery fee of $59 and another $30 or something. This is absolutely unacceptable for the issue i went through, IKEA needs to have email for us to send in these complaint with them."

The company they promote and are affiliated with is nothing more than a criminal organization who takes your money and then disappears.  It has been over 2 years now I ordered and paid for a 6kW installation and it is still not connected and the customers service is dead siclence. It is a pitty that Ikea associates itself with such a bad run company and doesn't take any responsibility in the wrongdoing of it.

Then I called the hideous delivery company and they told me the driver ran out of time and had to head back.  Reschedule for a second time and the table never arrived.  Again ikea had no answers. Called the delivery company and was told it was a bad address. Whatever that means.  Then I spoke to someone else who told me that the driver was lost.  So a third delivery was scheduled.  Two days later I got an email from ikea stating that they do not deliver to my area. I stated that on their site it stated that they do deliver to my area.  Anyway the woman told me that it must be an internal issue and that my money would be refunded in 5 to 7 business days.  Unbelievable how mismanaged this company is.  I don't know how they are still in business.  Do not deal with this company.  They are not worth your time and efforts. They should be giving me this table for free with what they have put me through!!"

  "articleText": "Like 3/4 of the reviews, customer service is appalling. I purchased 2 cellular blinds knowing I had to trim to fit the width of the recess in the window. I used a Stanley knife to carefully cut the tape used to seal the box it came in.The instructions were hiding the mechanism so it wasn't until I could see it, that I didn't have enough space left to cut the blind. I sealed the blind back and made my way back to IKEA.The customer service lady took both blinds off me and in front of me, used a biro pen to open the box, she damaged the box in the process and then said she would need to check if it could go back in the store for resale. She came back and said, as it had been opened, it can't go back in store. I was offered a voucher or 70% refund for BOTH blinds. I asked to speak to her manager who promptly came. He said that both blinds were opened? Clearly, the customer service lady opened up the sealed blind and I argued this point, all I got was the same 70% or vouchers! I asked to see the returns policy for opened items, the manager showed me the policy for unopened items but the policy for opened items was \"still being drafted\". So I said, so there's no policy in force then! After several arguments the manager agreed to give me a voucher and a full refund for the blind that was damaged by the biro. Still not happy and I could have got trading standards involved etc but for £30 I couldn't be bothered. I won't ever shop at IKEA again, obviously these reviews are not having any impact on IKEA's customer service so be aware before you buy."

I had waited for about 25 minutes on the phone, with the most annoying on-hold music ever, then when it was my turn it rang only once and they disconnected me then without answering. They never called back. If i have to call again it would be another useless 25 minutes. Terrible.It gets even worse since this has happened also with their customer service chat. When it was my turn the agent closed the chat before i wrote my question.Finally, after getting hold on the chat with them, it took literally about 70 minutes to get the issue solved. Just incredible!.This company's customer service quality level is terribly terrible, not even mentioning the wrong orders they send or their deteriorating product quality or the puzzling instructions."

I experienced this yesterday when tried to ask for a discount, which wasn't applied at the checkout. First of all I was waiting 35 mins in the queue. Just to mention, that the staff there wasn't busy with customers at all, as there was not many people waiting there. They were basically walking around, slowly of course, and having chats and one of them were sitting behind computer starring at the screen. When eventually I was called with the number, the woman there said that these type queries are not done here, but in another customer service  point. LOL but the problem is that there is no other point in Croydon branch, so she said that needed to ask her colleague for an advice. After another 10 mins of waiting for her colleague to finish his chat with the other representative, he confirmed, that I can apply for a refund! I tried to be helpful and speed up the process a bit, so I shown her photo I have taken on the shop floor to prove the discount. Surprisingly she rolled her eyes and laughed - this is unacceptable and I took that as really intentional and racist behavior as I am white. This customer service is poor and unacceptable. When I gave her my receipt to process the refund after 5 mins of having it in her hands she managed do tear it into 2 parts and then started to staple it! WHY?!!!!! now if i wanted to return any other of the products i bought this receipt wont be accepted i think! Lazy, unprofessional and racist customer service representatives -  IKEA Croydon -  please give your staff a proper training on manners and work etiquette as your reputation goes down!!! Horrible and beyond the joke!!!"

The deliveries came and the drivers checked every box off carefully. The next morning we took our old sofa to the dump and got started opening boxes to find that the corner piece is missing, rendering the whole sofa useless. I spent an hour and 10 minutes waiting for ikea to answer the phone to be told by an offensively cheerful youth that oops, sorry, we should have sent you an email and the corner unit would be with you in 10 days - he maintained his sunny and cheerful disposition throughout, even when I explained that I'm disabled, exhausted from moving house and in a great deal of pain, and I desperately need a comfortable place to rest, he didn't seem bothered at all. I burst into tears. My husband would have driven anywhere to get that corner unit for me but no it's not in any store, no you can't collect it from the warehouse, no it can't be delivered from the warehouse to a store, no exceptions can be made, you cannot have the one piece that makes your very expensive sofa useable, you must sit in your wheelchair for 10 long days with no break, with your bones shifting further out of place, trapping your nerves so your legs feel scalded with boiling water. Oopsie, it'll take you months to recover will it? Oh dear, can't have your visitors who were going to help you unpack, because there's nowhere to sit and you can't ask folks in their 70s to sit on the floor? Not to worry, the corner piece will be with you in 10 days, have a lovely day and here's a £20 voucher, don't spend it all at once. Ikea just don't give a ****."

She still sounded unsure and asked me to get in touch with the bank (IKANO) and abruptly ended the chat, without waiting to hear from me at all!!! I was stunned! This is incredibly disrespectful and downright rude! I filed a complaint through Ikea Online contact form and received a phone call from them. Again, the person on the other end was not sure as to whether I needed the damn proof of residency or not!!!

I was working so I left my daughter to direct them where to take the boxes but when she asked them to take them to the 3rd floor as requested he said No, IKEA does not let us do that (even though it was given to me as an option).

Then we checked with the staff there, they also found 23 in stock, but they said I should try click and collect.  Fine, when I got home in the evening, the website showed out of stock.  It is a mess completely, wasting my time, and such an unpleasant experience.  Hope that I can find another better company that I can shop furniture."

  "articleTitle": "Korken seals",
  "articleText": "Today I contacted customer service, on the one occasion I have asked for help in countless years of purchases from furniture to storage and  market place items.  I made a large investment over several years in Korken, kitchen storage jars.  These are displayed on the sales page with preserves in them.  I think as preserving jars they are fabulous and take the strain of water bathing for safe canning.  They are easily checkable after for the perfect seal.  I have never broken on in the several years of using them.You might wonder why only one star review!Packs of 5 rubber replacement seals vanished from the shelves about 18 months ago.  I was fobbed off in store with the idea they were probably in one of those shipping containers.  Last time I visited (6 months ago) I asked another real, live person ---- not they weren't in stock.  Today, in the busy months of preserving, I asked online.First I dealt with Billie Bot --- going in silly circles.  Finally even Billie Bot quit in favour of a person and Philippe came online.  Philippe was courteous and polite, but unable to offer any customer service whatsoever.  Like Billie Bot there were quotations of the company policy - it is discontinued, products become unavailable, Ikea holds the right to withdraw products.  An apology only when I explained how much I have invested in this glassware (plus all the other preserving materials like canning pans etc) and a promise to pass my complaint on.  I ask how this will work and when a response is expected.  Basically the response could be translated ' that the item is discontinued so i will just tell someone you are disgruntled and they will ignore you'.  What a company, that can't offer real customer service or offer resolution.  Ikea has lost my custom totally now -- no more purchases at all.  Beware if you think they look good and cheaper than Kilner...that's where it stops, maybe Kilner have a better customer service.  I haven't yet sourced rubber or something akin to the thickness of these seals (I have been looking since the last in person visit to store).  I think it must be rubbish to have a customer service role if you can't offer customer service, but I guess the initial purchases are the only interest...sad."

  "articleText": "I ordered a rug for delivery. I stayed home and was tracking my rug. As soon as it said that my rug was delivered I contacted IKEA because it had not been delivered. After 1&1/2 hours of being on the phone Ikea said that they would resend the rug the next Tuesday. I again stay home no rug. I call again. Oh sorry that request was never sent through. Let us give you a $25 gift card. Well that was not what I wanted but fine. I only mention it because it never came either. So they then say that I will get my rug on Friday. The next day I get a text saying that my rug will be delivered between 12 &4. I’m at work! Ya know so that I can buy rugs! I’m done with all of this so I call and waste more time canceling my order. I want a refund. I’m done. So she says 3-5 days for my refund. Well guess what? That request was never sent through so after 8 days I call. I’m told that it takes 10 days. WHAT? After 11 days I call again I’m told that the request was never sent through. I ordered the item on August 24th it’s September 20th and I have nothing. I was told yesterday that I will have my $ within 3 days. I believe that IKEA does this as a practice knowing that most people won’t put in the effort to get the $ back. This is a $200 item. Awful"

  "articleText": "Horrendous is an understatement.  I've spent 6.5 hours on the phone with their incompetent, rude, and careless customer service, riddled with people that don't know what they're doing.  Ikea used to be great, and that greatness died along with its founder.  Aside from the fact that they are wasting my time, and company time, by causing so much time to go down into the dregs of the toilet, they are also wasting their own resources, which I could care less about, by having their delivery partners drive all the way to my house on multiple occasions (3 companies, twice each, amounting to 6 trips), only for me to turn them away, because Ikea dropped the ball and didn't cancel/reschedule themselves, as discussed.  I'm providing these delivery partners with reference numbers, names, and dates, so they can be compensated for their wasted time that Ikea couldn't care less about. I messaged Ikea on instagram (at Ikea's public request in the comments), and they have gone unanswered; emails to customer service have gone unanswered, chat reps pass the buck and transfer you around until you give up---two weeks of this with no resolution in sight.  My best option is to file a charge back with my bank.  I would have been better off splurging on expensive furniture from Crate and Barrel and CB2, with all of the time I wasted with Ikea---their cheap, flat-box, formaldehyde off-gassing furniture just isn't worth it."

  "articleTitle": "Welcome to Dante's Ninth Level of Hell",
  "articleText": "If you MUST buy IKEA, go to their stores. Online is pure torture. Website ordering has flaws that will bite you. Customer service has minimal information and knowledge. Delivery dates are meaningless. Details: Moved daughter into off-campus apartment. Found two HAVSTRA products she wanted. They are \"real wood\", not the typical compressed sawdust. Wood is mediocre quality. Not the clear grade wood in quality furniture. However, knots and such are fairly well hidden since they use paint, not stain, to color the wood. If you get dark color, any dings, etc. will be very visible. They also do not paint the back side so you have to place against a wall or have raw wood visible. Instructions are pictures only so no way to communicate any warnings beyond one or two basics. The \"quicklock\" screws MUST go in exactly straight. Remove and retry if they start going crooked, otherwise you will split the wood. Pre-drilled holes are inconsistent in size. One dowel will be completely loose and another will be a struggle to get in. Alignment was accurate enough to assemble joints but some needed some real effort. Either save money and buy self-assemble furniture at Walmart or buy real furniture from a real furniture store. Decided to order online and have shipped because items came in boxes weighing 60+ pounds according to their website. You enter delivery instructions in a box. There is actually a character limit but if you exceed it, the box turns red and you get \"information entered not in expected format\" message. Customer service was clueless and while on extended hold while they tried to find out what that meant, I managed to figure it out. After submitting order, you never see your delivery instructions again in any IKEA emails. Had specified Sept. 9 delivery date on order placed twelve days earlier. Sept. 5 email said order had shipped with Sept. 9 delivery. On Sept. 7, delivery confirmation received with delivery date field blank. Why send email saying delivery is confirmed then? Turned out blank meant not being delivered. Did not receive call on Sept. 8 with delivery time window that I was told to expect. Called delivery vendor (GoBolt in my area) on Sept. 9 and found myself in heaven. They are polar opposite of IKEA. They were the ones that told me nothing was being delivered that day. They only know they have an IKEA delivery to make when the motor freight truck delivers it to them. They get no notification from IKEA. They explained the entire process and answered every question. Prior call that morning to IKEA customer service was useless and hung up after being put on hold for 3-4 times. Also, you MUST have exact order number for IKEA to ATTEMPT to help. They have no way to look it up. On the evening of 9th, noticed I had another delivery confirmation email from that aternoon and the delivery date was NOT blank. Had Sept 13. First thing following Monday, called GoBolt again. They confirmed they did have my order to deliver the next day. Gave me a four hour delivery window and my place in the delivery queue. Confirmed that they actually received my delivery instructions from IKEA too. On morning of 13th, received a link from GoBolt that let me track the delivery truck. After completing delivery prior to me, driver texted me that they were on the way to me. Delivery was fast, courteous and very professional. GoBolt was wonderful but I will never buy from IKEA ever again for the rest of my life."

On delivery day they only bring 2/3 of the stuff I ordered and the rest doesn't show up, several hours later I get an email from Ikea saying my items weren't available at the time they were loading the truck so they are refunding me and I can re-order again.  They won't offer free shipping for the parts they missed, I should also mention the parts still show as in stock on the site so it's not as though they aren't in stock and it was an inventory glitch, the only glitch was the lazy effers who did not load the truck right.

I was told the drivers are always in the area and my items would be with me soon.I've tried to contact IKEA through their customer service Twitter page, where I've been steadfastly ignored, through their chat bot, which constantly promises a human to talk to who never appears, and have tried to email the contact address they text to you with your delivery date (it got sent back as a mailer daemon). I can't phone as I'm ill and have lost my voice, and I imagine many more people are unable to phone for a variety of reasons.Today, 10 days later, I have received in the evening a text and email with a twelve hour delivery period for \"tomorrow\" September the 2nd, that date was 10 days ago.Now I get to go to sleep worrying that they'll turn up to my house tomorrow, where I am ill, with a huge amount of furniture and no warning.

  "articleTitle": "Beware of buying IKEA Floor Models",
  "articleText": "I left IKEA Renton with a functioning clock today. But first I was told by 3 IKEA employees that I had to go home with a totally broken, unusable item that cost $50.99. The reason? The item was sold As-Is.I interacted with 2 IKEA employees when I purchased this item. The website was reporting that there were 4 of these clocks in stock, but there were none. I asked a salesperson about this and she asked if I wanted to buy the floor model and I said Yes. She directed me to another part of the store where another employee took the clock, then gave it back to me, without a word. He gave me a tag that said in huge black letters on a yellow background: $50.99. The original price was $59.99. I didn’t think this was much of a discount, but I didn’t say anything.When I got home, I printed the instructions from the IKEA website, and I inserted new batteries. According to the instructions, the numbers were supposed to start flashing, but they didn’t. I tried to insert a USB cable, but it would not go in. The instructions did not say what kind of cable to use and it didn’t come with a cable. The clock did not work at all.I prepared to return the item. I got the tag and receipt. Now that I had my glasses on, I could see that the tag said in very small letters, under the price, “ASIS Non-Refundable.” I didn’t think that would be a problem. I wasn’t planning to ask for a refund. I just wanted a store credit. I assumed that a reputable company like IKEA would issue a store credit for an item that was totally broken. I never imagined that a company like IKEA would expect me to pay $50.99 for merchandise that was unusable. But I was mistaken.I went to the Returns area 2 weeks later and told the IKEA employee that called my name that I would like a store credit for an item that was broken. She said it was As-Is so she could not take it back. I explained that no one told me it was As-Is and As-Is was printed in tiny letters that I didn’t see because I did not have my glasses on. She called a manager in Recovery and when she hung up, she handed the clock back to me and said they would not give me a store credit.I said that was unacceptable, and that I wanted to talk to the Recovery manager.The Recovery manager came out and was insulting. She reiterated that the item was As-Is and said several times that I had waited “a month” to return it. I bought it exactly 2 weeks prior. She said I could put on my glasses, turn over the receipt, and read the As-Is policy which is printed on the back. She said they would not give me a refund. I said I didn’t ask for a refund, that I wanted a store credit. She said no. I said that is unacceptable, I want to talk to your manager.Soon a third IKEA employee came over to talk to me. She pointed out that the area I went to to get the tag 2 weeks ago, had a sign that says As-Is.1. I didn’t notice the sign2. Even if I did, I would not know that it applied to me because no one said As-Is to me, only Floor Model.3. Even if I was told the clock was As-Is, I would still expect a store credit if the item turned out to be totally broken and unusable.She said IKEA’s As-Is policy is very strict. I said, if that’s your policy, and you are going to enforce it with no exceptions, you need to train your employees to explain that to customers. She said I had waited “over a month” to return it. It was, in fact, exactly 2 weeks. She also referenced the fact that the clock had been “deeply discounted.” The clock was discounted less than 10%. Since it didn’t come with the cable included with new clocks, I would have to purchase one, which really makes the discount closer to 5%. That is not a deep discount. Eventually she took the clock in the back, and returned with it in about 2 minutes. It was working. I asked what they did and she said they just put batteries in it. I put new batteries in it and it did not work, so I don’t know what happened.IKEA clearly puts time and effort into training it’s employees to enforce its As-Is policy even when circumstances make it unethical to do so, as they were in my case today. It may be legal. It is not ethical.IKEA needs to redirect some of the energy it puts into training employees to enforce the As-Is policy, into training employees to make the As-Is policy clear to customers before they buy one of these items. For example, “This is a floor model which means it is sold As-Is which means it cannot be returned, even for store credit, even if you find it doesn’t work at all.”I couldn’t even throw it in the trash because it requires special disposal.I wanted to put this in writing and submit it to IKEA, but when I called customer service I was told that there is no email or physical mailing address for IKEA.I do like my clock very much."

  "articleText": "I ordered few stuff 2 different sizes Pax wardrobe and when I was almost finish building it ( this is the the 100cm length ), then I saw the the right under part and other things is broken so it can effect the wardrobe it’s self to stand. I called the call center right away to complain about it and they agreed to change the whole package. Then I opened the second package from Pax wardrobe 50cm length and check it right away then I found out exactly the same broken part. It was funny because the broken part it’s on the same place but from the packaging doesn’t have hole. It means the didn’t check it right before the did the packaging and send it to the customers. Then I called the call center again that I want to cancel so they can take the stuff back and the want me to pay for pick up arrangement. It’s not my fault that this happens, it’s their faults not to check the the goods before they sending it. What kind of service is that? I paid the delivery service it’s self already 89,99 euros and now they want me to pay for pick up even though it’s not my mistake???? Pleas IKEA, if you don’t want to get any complain do the quality control correctly. I will not complain if I’m satisfied with the goods but because this is not the first it’s happened to me that’s why I’m very disappointed and angry. Please be professional taking care of problems from customer. By the way this one is for IKEA GERMANY!"

  "articleText": "I don't usually bother writing reviews, but calling the Ikea customer support line has just been so frustrating regarding my replacement delivery, I really wanted to say something. Especially when I finally got my store's direct number, and realized that calling the store is like unbelievably less painful and stressful?? Like the difference was astonishing, my brain could not even fully process in the moment how easily my issue was resolved, compared to the call agents that almost seemed like they have no idea what to do. Then also, why has none of the 10+ call agents I talked to considered giving me the store's direct phone number? Or tell me to consider going to the store directly? Instead, I was trying so hard to work with them, telling them the same issue over and over again, only to get hung up on, left on hold, or ending up with no solutions or answers.The issue was my replacement delivery didn't happen in the time frame, or day that NGL (their delivery company) gave me, which was supposed to be 8am to 12pm. I even called at around 11:30am to double check, and they said it would arrive within 15 minutes. Then it was past 12pm and it still didn't arrive...I had to leave, so I called my apartment office to check again at around 2pm, and it STILL didn't arrive. On top of that, nobody called or emailed me to inform me. I had to call NGL again to know that they wouldn't be able to make the delivery that day. Then they told me to call again to ask about the new delivery date, but when I called again, they said that it got cancelled. So I had to try figuring out what happened from the support line, and like I said earlier, was very frustrating and not very helpful.Overall, just very disappointing considering all the hype and good things I hear about Ikea."

After calling and waiting for 50min ikea said the 3 doors and a clothes rail was not in stock and didn't know when the would be available again I told them that's no good to Me as I have half a product and not a complete one so I would like a refund. Ikea said there will be a £25 charge to collect the rest of the package up because I have changed my mind and don't want them anymore, I became upset and said I never changed my mind I ordered a completed wardrobe in store checked that all parts was available and set aside for delivery before making payment in store. Ikea changed there mind not me by sending a text on the day of delivery to Me saying my order has been cancelled. So ikea changed there mind not me. im been charged £25 very bad customer service ikea. Its actually not my fault and should not be charged as I never cancelled part of the order ikea did."

On the day the delivery was due, no one contacted me and since then I started making phone calls with the call center (customer service). to find out that nothing is known about my order and that the logistics department is not responding to any requests from them. In the meantime I said to call the courier company PRO NATUR where I talked to a lady and she told me that they do not have a pick-up order from IKEA. And so IKEA has been walking for more than a few days with the fact that nothing is known about the order, where it is or what happened to it. In addition to this, after I placed the order and paid it a week away, I am called to be told that some products are no longer in stock, as I when I ordered them (i expected that since you order to be booked at that time).....Honestly, after this experience, this is the last time I call on their services. My experience is 0 with them and their services for which they boast are 0. L.E.I was yesterday on 22.08.2022 in the IKEA Baneasa store to report that the furniture is not delivered and I would like to know what is happening. Customer relations was nice and helped me and explained that a mess happened and that the next day on 23.08.2022 the order will be delivered between 10-12, 100%. The money for the transport was returned to me. They probably felt ei...in fine. Today the surprise did not arrive the order, Fact that made me go again to IKEA Baneasa to find out that you can not deliver the order and that it is a problem that I do not know what product disappeared from stock and I can not livra...in the conditions in which yesterday it was on stock..anyway I had to go again convincing work with them to get that order once... they told me they'd arrive today, i'm curious if it would happen. I come back with the final experience. It seems to me a purely Romanian comedy as only we know how to make...... (that is, how to make a better fool of the client :) ).L.E.-2: The order was finally delivered and from the discussion with the delivery guys we learned that it happens extremely often at least in the last year that the orders are late. The transport guys were at IKEA Baneasa this morning and they were waiting to pick up the shipment just that I could not because of a product that said it was not in stock only that suddenly they found it by magic...anyway I hope you will figure out what you are dealing with if you want to order. It is possible that the same thing will happen to you and I honestly do not know how they behave with customers who are outside Bucharest. I live 5km from IKEA Baneasa and I had such an experience. I encourage other buyers to report these issues and make as many complaints as possible because otherwise nothing changes."

Delivery was supposed to be a few days ago on Monday. The evening before that, I received an email that the delivery was postponed till today. However, today I still have not received a delivery window, and it's also appearantly not out for delivery either. The customer service forwarded me to the resolution center, at which I spoke with someone who apparantly had zero interest in helping me apart from \"call again if you don't hear anything today\".

  "articleText": "Worst customer support I have ever received. When ordering online, they randomly split my order in two deliveries and changed the delivery date for one of the deliveries to an earlier date when I was not in town.When opening a chat they tell you to reach out to customer support via phone. After waiting for 30 minutes, you get someone who does not speak english. They will transfer you to an English speaking agent. After waiting another 15 minutes they simply hang up the phone. After going through this 5 times you finally talk to someone. (We're 2h after the first call now.) They say they will change the delivery date to the one from the other delivery. All looks fixed.Next day checking for the estimated delivery time and part of the delivery is still set for the wrong date. Going through the above again before getting someone on the phone. This agents tells us nothing is changed in the system but he will do it for us. All looks fixed, again. However, next day still nothing changed in the account and we're the day before the estimated delivery day. Again going through the above, this person promising us to change the date. All looks fixed, again x2.Off course, they try to deliver the parcels on the wrong date even though we've been told 3 times the date was changed. After the delivery attempt they write you an email saying you'll have to pay for the return cost because nobody was at home.Absolute joke of customer support and feels like an absolute scam and waste of time. This is the first review I ever write because I normally don't do this but people please be aware, IKEA is cheap so they look for all other ways to scam you and take money out of your pocket."

I explained everything, was put on hold and hung up after a few minutes.I called back an hour later forwarded me again and was told that I would get a call the next morning, which was the 29th.  That didn't happen and called Again, got forwarded, put me on hold.  They wanted talk to someone and find out what's going on.  They didn't answer, left a voicemail with all my info including my phone number.I got a call back on Monday August 1st and had to reschedule.  The soonest date was August 15th.  Before getting off the phone, I asked if can just pick it up before the delivery date.  She said yes and call before the delivery.I called back August 11th and was told to cancel it and reorder due to the delivery payment.  I didn't want to start over so they forwarded to the movers about what was going on.  Of course they told me to contact IKEA.The delivery process and information needed is Unacceptable.  I blame the 3rd party movers for all the delays and Not on the same page with IKEA."

  "articleText": "We have started to plan our kitchen in March 2021 our kitchen been finished April 2022.We do understand it been tricky couple of years with many sets back. However, the service which we have received was beyond poor. Once we have planned our kitchen, we had preinstallation person come in to take measurements. After the installer guy came to have a look at the kitchen and take measurements. I believe it was June 2021 . We were happy to go ahead book installation (at that point was supposed to be September October) Unfortunately we were not able to do so as parts of the kitchen were not available. Once parts become available we were able to book installation date. We been given installation date for January.At that point we were frustrated as it been taken months so we wanted to cancelled the whole order. I called in and asked to cancelled the order the person said they will see what they can do and if they can bring the date forward. When she got back to me she said the order ( whole of the kitchen will be deliver 29th  August ) and the installation will happen first week in September . Days to go to September nobody got back to be so I tried to chase up. I got answer it  was a mistake and the installation is still happening in January .So I called again to cancelled.  Again I was told they will bring the installation forward. So they did to December. The installer guy came . Checked the measurements and said its wrong.  How frustrating.  Me again trying to contact ikea to sort out the issue. It  took several emails once I got an answer. At that stage part of the order was already delivered which wasn't convenient to have a desk top in the small house with a crawling baby .The installation was story on its on.Our breakfast bar was not existing. The long door on one of the cupboard were four half's. Parts of the kitchen and the water tap been poorly fitted. One of the electrical socket is not in working order since the installation. I am not mentioning parts of the order were missing or haven't been added to our order. I contacted customer service several times just to be told they will deal with everything once is finished. Once everything been finished I called up again just to be told I need to fill up feedback form. I filled up feed back form twice, nobody got back to us. I went to the IKEA store two months ago, hoping they be able to help me. Two months later still no answer no sorry for the bad service or money off from the service provided. Which we been told it will happen once everything is finished.If IKEA customer service reading this email I would appreciate if they get in touch with us."

It was moved to the first available Saturday but two days before I was informed no one would have come as they were not able to deliver when promised.They rescheduled the order on August 4 (a weekday again).I called the customer service to point out that it could not work from me but in order not to postpone this again I asked that at least the delivery be planned in the window between 5 and 9 pm. Ikea confirmed they could.On August 4, I received another email at 12.30, while in the office, to say that the delivery had been failed as I was not at home.I called the customer service again, complaining about it and asking that it be rescheduled the following day.They gave me August 12 as first available date (again a week day) and told me they had raised a complaint to see if it was possible to have them before.On 5 August I received an email saying that the order would be delivered on that day. I stayed home all day to receive a tea spoon. The bed, the couch, all the kitchen stuff basically everything else was missing (so 2 days wasted at home nothing at this point).On August 12 I decided to work remotely to make sure the delivery was not failed again.No one showed up, no one rang the bell, no one tried to call me. I received an email saying the delivery was delayed and another one saying it was failed.I called the customer service number again and apparently there was nothing they could do to get in touch with the NAL group.Generally the NAL Group handling deliveries for IKEA does not pick up the phone, does not respond on the website chat and does not get back to emails. It is practically unreachable.Ikea and NAL group do not pass information coming from customer.I will never ever buy anything at IKEA again and I strongly discourage anyone from doing it.Not only you don’t get the furniture, but you waste money and a lot time.They ended up causing damages to me.I slept on an inflatable mattress for one month because every week I was told the delivery would have come. I wasted three full days at home for nothing.I need to buy all the furniture again.It’s pure nightmare."

Second delivery turns up two days later even though I had to inform Ikea that they actually sent the order ( are you as confused as us at this point?…)We realise that the order is not complete in the end so in conclusion, countless phone calls and lots of frustration later, nothing is being resolved and customer service have no clue what has happened.

  "articleText": "Well I used to be a fan but now I am not. This store is a mess and no management in place at all for customer service and company policy. I went online and ordered my daughter a dresser. We go the store to shop and pick it up. When I went to pick up the dresser we are told “ it will take a while because I was unlucky and it just tastes a little while to get it.” I wait with my wife and two little children, 8 and 5 for over an hour. Without telling me any updates I watch everyone behind me get their items and I was left as the only person after closing hours to still never receive my product. They tell me the dresser is in a restricted area and I had to wait until all the customers in the store leave the building before I can get my dresser. No apologies, no offer of anything to try to make a bad situation better. They tell me it’s just bad luck. I speak to 2 managers and one says he can offer me 20 bucks for the inconvenience. Lol.    My kids are tired and hungry and I send my family to go to dinner while I stay behind waiting for the entire store to close while they finally bring me my dresser. I am now to wait outside with no lights with my product and they say sorry again we just can’t do anything to earn your business back and can’t offer anything for our mistake and apologies and I’m told 4 times they did nothing wrong and that’s just how the company works. Again out of watching many people get their product brought to them I was the only one who could not get mine during store ours as I waited to be the very last customer. Where in the wild does this happen? Who’s company policy states that that is ok? How you staff from IKEA appreciate being treated the way my family and I were. This in embarrassing and a disgrace of a company. Do not shop here!"

The moment you do, it becomes unavailable but suggest you to select click and collect, and surprise, the item is not available in your closest ikea, instead you would have to drive 200km to get it from another store - ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR EFFING MIND GUYS?? It helps to know that I've already been to the closest store before and said article wasn't available.

  "articleText": "I ordered a SONGESAND King-Size Bed Frame, a VESTMARKA Sprung Mattress, LURÖY Slatted Bed Base, SKORVA Midbeam and some LAPPTÅTEL Pillows.All of this totalled £434.00. I ordered it on 25th July and paid an additional £50 for \"express\" delivery for which I was given an option of delivery the following day, 26th July, which was ideal because we were expecting an elderly couple visiting us to arrive on 27th July. How pleased we were that Ikea were providing us \"the wonderful everyday\".The following day, I checked a few times on my tracker, the progress of my order. When we got to around 2pm and the items were still shown as \"packing your order\" I began to suspect all was not well. I called Ikea and the lady I spoke to called the local store from where the order was coming from (Wembley store) to find out what was wrong. Having hung on the phone for a considerable time whilst being at work (yes, some of us have to so we can pay for Ikea purchases), I was told that the order had been prepared but the delivery company had not collected the items. No one, either the lady I was speaking with, nor anyone at the store, could provide any explanation as to why they had not been collected.However, the lady I was speaking to re-processed my order, sending me an email verification, to say that the order would be delivered the following day, 27th July. I received the confirmation and eagerly awaited delivery. I took time off work so that the bed could be fully assembled before our visitors arrived. Whilst all these arrangements were being made, I received another email for my order, this time stating I had not paid for the items and changing the order number. I phoned again and spoke to a different lady. We examined both orders and she went away to gain an explanation from the store as to why this order had been amended. After 30 minutes, I was told that no one at the store could provide any explanation, the named person on the order was not available and that now, my order was not going to be delivered today (27th) but would \"definitely\" be delivered tomorrow (28th). I explained the difficulties this was causing me but was told that nothing could be done. It was at this point that I was offered the opportunity to have a full refund which I declined as it would leave me in the lurch as to obtaining the new bed and probably more practical difficulties in finding a replacement. I stated I would be in touch when I was in possession of the goods, understandably sceptical that the bed would arrive.That evening, our elderly visitors had to sleep on the couch (an ikea couch, ok for sitting, atrocious for sleeping). Because of the nature of our son's disability, it was not possible for them to have our bed.On 28th, the bed finally arrived.I have called Ikea today. The person I was speaking to offered me a £30 gift voucher as compensation. I felt I was entitled to a little more, given the rubbish nature of the \"express\" delivery. He went off to consult with his team leader and after 15 minutes, I was told that nothing further would be offered. I declined the £30 gift voucher as I do not intend to use Ikea again for anything.Clearly, I should have used Trustpilot before ordering but I have to say, I was genuinely taken aback by the rating and sheer number of poor reviews on here for Ikea. So, we've had all this inconvenience, my extended time on the phone dealing with these matters (2.5 hours total) and an elderly couple complaining of back pain and Ikea won't even consider giving me back my £50 for the delivery.I'm sorry Ikea, perhaps with the sheer weight of poor reviews, you are swamped, overwhelmed and concerned about profits being eaten into if you were to make proper, decent offers to your customers and have given up trying to even maintain a semblance of customer service. Yes, I expect there might be some conditions buried within delivery arrangements which absolve you of responsibility. Having read other reviews, my experience is not as huge compared to others. But, really? \"The Wonderful Every Day\" honestly? Am I so naïve to have expected so much more?David Martell"

In order, she and the “higher-up”;1. tried to convince me I was on the wrong website;2. told me I misunderstood the sentence;3. told me to ignore that part and read a different part of the page, which was unrelated to both my order & my request, and finally;4. told me to ignore the page entirely and instead read another.She finally said she wasn’t going to escalate it further and nobody in the company would talk to me about it any more. Disgraceful.IKEA is a massive company and I’m sure managing a big website is complex. But public information is a promise, and I made a purchase based on that info. The right thing to do would be accept the refund and to update the page.TLDR: Big company fobs off customer hoping I’ll just take it. They can deal with the chargeback now."

  "articleText": "We bought an Isande fridge freezer which went faulty start of May this year, with the alarm repeatedly triggering because the freezer can’t reach temperature resulting in the compressor running constantly and getting dangerously hot. So far we’ve not been able to get a replacement because IKEA refuse to communicate with their UK regional Electrolux teams who manage guarantee repairs. We’ve had four attempted repair visits from Electrolux’s regional representatives each resulting in no fix and now are stuck with a defective unit. The last engineer allowed me to photograph his report form saying the fridge freezer cannot be economically repaired, which was sent to Electrolux. IKEA say all we can do is raise an internal complaint which so far is getting us nowhere, so I want to warn all potential electrical item purchasers to avoid IKEA as they do not honour their guarantees any more. You don’t want to be without a fridge freezer when the UK reaches 40 degrees C, as we have been."

The third had a \"spider\" crack in the middle of the perspex. I called their customer service straight away (1 minute wait it said - was actually 8m 30 seconds) and the man I dealt with (poss French from accent) was very helpful. Checked my order, checked the stock and was able to create another order to be sent out and delivered on Tuesday. I asked if he was providing a label for returns and said that it wasnt neccessary I could safely destroy it.I havent had the replacement yet, but Ive had the new order schedule on the email, so no reason to think it wont arrive.  The two that were Ok, are very good value.The loss of 1 star is because there was no damage to the box, and there was nothing IN the box what could have caused that type of damage, so the order pickers couldnt have been checking items properly before packing. Despite the mishap, definitely will use again, very eager to put the problem right so I wasnt at a loss."

  "articleText": "The delivery service was terrible. Usually, Ikea delivers the order the next day. And at the particular time of the delivery, the employee from the delivery service of Ikea called me and said that the address was incorrect. I'm sure it was 100% correct because I saw the correct one in the order. And he was already on the way, just in case I sent my address to his phone number from which he was calling. Still, he just canceled the delivery, and that's all. as a result, I spent my Saturday evening waiting for delivery and didn't receive anything. \"Thanks\" for such a nice service, Ikea!My order number was 1295219095"

(Not the kitchens because the construction doesn't allow for pipes or conduits at the back -it's a Swedish thing?)The staff at my nearest IKEA at Straiton are really helpful but I'm taking a star off (above) because the company doesn't appear to encourage its employees to take pride in the 'Swedishness' of the products. They aren't shown how to pronounce the names and they aren't given incentives to learn about Sweden or visit. If I'm wrong, I'll happily rewrite this review."

  "articleText": "I am writing hoping to resolve an ongoing issue with Ikea Indonesia.I do not know if Ikea is closing in Indonesia, if they are having financial problems or what however I am getting no where with an order that was placed and paid in full on May 24, 2022.I have ordered over $10,000 worth of products online from Ikea Indonesia with no problems and great delivery until recently.I placed 3 large orders within days of each other 2 orders have arrived and 1 is now almost two months without delivery or further updates.This is both frustrating as the products are specified for projects now being held up because they are not delivered but more frustrating is the absolutely useless, horrible, chaotic, unresponsive customer service in Ikea Indonesia.I contacted customer service after 3 weeks - it took a week to respond -then they were checking - 6 weeks after the order a customer service rep called and said they were missing 1 item from a large order and thus nothing had been shipped.I asked why I was being informed of this after 6 weeks of waiting for the order - why they didn’t ship the items that were in stock, why I wasn’t offered choice to change the items and why no one was following up on the shipment of the order.I was sent an option to replace the one missing item which I accepted and was told the shipment should arrive shortly.  It is now another 10 days - no shipment- no response - nothing.Please assist before I am forced to take legal action and publish my unbelievable problems dealing with Ikea here."

Did not get a call from the delivery company and I had to rearrange the delivery for a week after that. Also I had to wait for one and a half hours on the phone just for somebody to pick up. When I rearranged the delivery the customer service agent did not put the information that I already paid for the for the delivery and for the products resulting that they canceled again my order. Then I had to go to the shop explain them everything had to wait for another week to get my things. Meanwhile i had no bed to sleep on because they couldn't get their programming right. Got a refund but they charged me twice for the delivery. The customer service is just awful , and i takes to long to talk to an employee, especially on the phone.! Did not expect such thing in Sweden."

  "articleText": "I don't live near an IKEA store (nearest is 2.5 hours away), but I purchased four of the highly-touted FRAKTA bags that moms of college students rave about for packing clothes and linens for easy moving in and out of student housing. I bought them the first week of July, they were delivered on July 7, and I opened one of the four that day just to see how it works. We moved our son on July 18, and one of the 3 unopened bags had a seam that was not completely stitched on the bottom of the bag. When he put his clothing into that bag, he saw there was a hole right away. I did a live chat with IKEA that evening to see if it was possible to get a replacement or refund. They said in order for that to happen, I had to notify them of the defect within 48 hours of delivery. FORTY-EIGHT HOURS. Officially the shortest defective product warranty in history. I told them next time I'll buy the Amazon knock-offs. At least they have a decent refund/return policy. Never again, IKEA!"

  "articleText": "Just another of thousands of bad reviews I see. Purchased a bed frame which I traveled 300 hundred kilometers to do. I was shown a complete frame that would hold a foam mattress, mattress sold separately which is expected. At home assembled the bed frame but half the parts were missing. Absolutely no customer service, no phone numbers but they have a fictional billi bot which did no work 5 days in a row hence the fictional not comment. So I drove another 300 kilometers and was told the the other half of the bed frame was sold separately. This is like selling a dresser without drawers or a coach without cushions. So I drove a total of 1200 kilometers and paid for a useless frame and the WORST purchasing experience of my life (63 years). Horrible company don't waste your time or money, it should be illegal maybe a lawyer can way in on this."

  "articleText": "Ordered two ( large / medium) items for home delivery (€60). Received a delivery date and spent the day at home to ensure we were there for the delivery ( really needed the furniture)  Kept an eye on the delivery tracker all day. About 6pm the delivery van was on our street. We were at the door and saw the van down the street. He was a good bit down so we were waiting for him to come, and while waiting we cleared some space at the door - did not leave the area. Then got a messaged saying delivery attempt failed. We immediately called customer service and noted with them that the delivery man was down the street- he must have tried the wrong house but he never called us and we had our eircode on the delivery address. We asked that they call the delivery driver and get him to come back - he couldn’t have been but 5 mins away. He refused. I was pretty annoyed as i feel it should be standard to check the eircode and also ring the customer. Having paid €60 for delivery i felt like a better service was to be expected. I asked for a refund of my delivery payment. This was refused. Another delivery date was set up for Saturday - bit of a pain having to be stuck in the house on Saturday for the whole day. But lucky we were home as delivery said 2pm-6pm and was actually delivered at 1pm."

Absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable.Do better than this to stop the COVID spread, IKEA!

When order n 1285275694 arrived, the value described was £1,272.25, half of the order, When I returned to the store I was informed that the system stated that the order was all delivered and that half and the wardrobe that was in the wrong size would be exchanged. So I innocently bought another £1,498 on order n1287942571 the bed to bed settee and mudp servant which never arrived.So began the saga to change their wardrobe and return £1,272.26.today, 07/12, I still have my house full of boxes that I never put together for fear of the wrong order, they already promised to come and exchange three different days and they never came and I lost 1,272.26 because in the system it says that everything was delivered and it's not true , I live a nightmare."

  "articleTitle": "Horrible customer service",
  "articleText": "I have recently made a large order through IKEA in Norway. I did not receive several of the products that I ordered as the website does not accurately describe why the products are not actually available, so you do not know until you call customer service, why each item it not available and if you can even get it or not.More importantly, the customer service is some of the worst I have ever experienced. I actually have saved a conversation with a customer service representative who left the conversation, mid conversation because I asked to speak to someone who could provide me with more help as she said my request was \"impossible\". I was simply requesting to change a delivery date to a later date. She refused to do anything to help me or explain why she could not move my delivery date further back. She told me she would send me an email and never did.I next, talked with another representative on the phone who said he would help me with trying to change the shipping date of the order and would call me back later in the day. I received a very cold SMS later that day only stating my request was not possible with no way for me to send a message back.I then got ahold of a 3rd representative who finally explained the issue to me, but again did nothing to help and by this point, my shipment had already been shipped. This was a couple days after making my order and I had been trying since day one to change the shipment. The representative told me that we could try to get the shipment shipped to somewhere nearby but there were no promises and I had to wait just before the items left the warehouse.The problem is that we have not moved into the place yet and there is no way for us to receive the order at that location until mid July (over a week after the shipment will arrive). I am 6 months pregnant, taking care of a 2 year old alone and my husband works at sea. We now have to hire a car and helpers to receive the shipment and bring it to another location, only to have to hire people once again to bring the items to our new place when we move in, in mid July.I would have canceled the order, but the problem there was that we are having to fully furnish the apartment and if we did not receive these items, I would have to be sleeping and eating on the floor until I found a new bed table etc... somewhere else.I will never order form IKEA again and will continue to make sure others I know don't either."

Ever since 29/6 the IKEA online tracking has showed \"Order received - Packing your order - Getting ready to dispatch\" (still today on 8/7).The delivery was not made so I called customer service on Tuesday 5/7. I was promised a new delivery on Thursday 7/7. According to the IKEA online tracking this delivery never even entered \"packing\" stage. Obviously no delivery was made.I called the IKEA customer service again on Friday 8/7 (today). Somebody answered immediately (unexpected as previous time I had to wait over 10 minutes before anybody answered). The person mumbled very quietly, but I managed to tell what had happened and he took my order number. He put me on a hold. I waited for 18 minutes and then he hung up the call.Update a week later (on 14/7). Yet another call to IKEA. Yet another wait. Yet another person. This one listened, was polite, acted, corrected the earlier mistakes, and rescheduled (again) the delivery. The delivery actually did come. Unlike IKEA claims, no prior text message or a call came, just the driver ringing the doorbell. However, I was home and received every item I had ordered. I am happy this ordeal is finally over, and increase my rating from one to three stars. However, it takes more trust building before I am happy with IKEA again."

The fitters were great and did all the could but obviously couldn't complete the installation because not everything was present.Roll on 6 months later, and after basically having rung IKEA every week since the installation, I now have all the doors, they have refunded us for the tap but I am yet to receive a splash back - which they measured incorrectly from the off!! They did send me an alternative splash back last week, but the difference in quality was a joke despite previously being reassured that it was like-for-like (just to put it in context, it was like comparing one sheet of paper to some thick cupboard in quality) it was just disappointing.I'm bored and sick of having to call IKEA now every other day rather than weekly, as I just want to get it sorted. Some of the customer care team are helpful, some are just not interested. There is no communication, no reassurance at all. I appreciate stock issues are happening everywhere at the moment, but to be left in the dark with no update nor communication is just disappointing and disrespectful. As a customer (and having worked in customer service too), I am frustrated and annoyed it is still not resolved. My new kitchen experience has been totally ruined and thoroughly stressful."

  "articleTitle": "The worst customer service",
  "articleText": "I love IKEA, but my most recent experience ordering online has been horrible. I ordered a table for delivery and it was cancelled about a week before it was supposed to be delivered because it was out of stock. This table is almost always unavailable or out of stock, so when it was available, I jumped on the opportunity. I talked to customer service through their chat service and they were awful and so unprofessional--I've never experienced worse customer service. At the end of it all, they told me to order it again (it had become available online again), so I did. A week later, I got another message saying it was delayed by a week, fine. 3 days before my already a week delayed delivery date I got another message saying it's out of stock and I would be refunded. Talked to customer service and they told me to reorder it AGAIN and that it would be available this time! And that the reason it was cancelled was because my card was declined, even though it was already processed and posted weeks ago, AND I got a message saying it was because it was out of stock. So now I've waited about a month for this same table, been refunded twice already, and I don't have a dining table for an event I'm hosting next weekend. He kept trying to prematurely end the conversation by saying \"Is there anything else I can help you with?\" even though I clearly wasn't done...the last time he sent that message, then after literally 15 seconds of no response from me he disconnected the chat because of no response. This is probably the 5th person I've talked to via IKEA's customer service chat and they've all been so terrible. One of the people asked probably 10 times throughout the chat \"Well, how are you today?\" when I was clearly frustrated about my order, which is so frustrating it's almost comical. Mind you, this wasn't that long of a conversation and it was asked at random times."

  "articleTitle": "Be careful Ikea kitchen offers, because they are cheating on final price/offer!",
  "articleText": "We bought kitchen from you (without white goods). We talked with two different sellers at the time and we finalized the price for 22 468 dkk (in that price delivery is included) and we made an order.At the end it looked like this;You basically sold us a kitchen for 22 000 dkk indeed, but without cabinet fronts (front doors) on FEW of them, so the price for your offer wasnt real. Nice trick Ikea. Price of 22 000 for that kitchen wasnt real because we stayed without half of items (very relevant ones), and gave us unfinished kitchen for which we believed in that time when we were sitting there for two hours with your seller that he is selling us (like any other normal person would think) the WHOLE product for that price. Offer for 22 000, but actually for 25 000 (3000dkk more for buying afterwards the things which HAD to be included. Tell me. Who is buying such a mess? So we bought few fronts for cabinets, but decided to leave few of them without. Are you serious? Such a unfinished kitchen? It simply cannot be more clear than what it is that you tried (and you did unfortunatey) to do. Sell us a kitchen for 22 000, from your side fully aware that for that price we will not get what we HAD to have so that we can accept the offer as soon as possible so you are finished with us. You sold us a kitchen, because we fell for the trick of 22 000. Because if it were 25 000 we wouldnt accept it? Nicely done Ikea. Why did our drawing has every cabinet, has every front doors on those cabinets, why then that kitchen drawing looks so finished? Why we recieved and bought few fronts, but decided to leave few of them without? Widely open and “beautiful”? P.S. Very important. Ikea still sold and brought to me all the hingens for doors. You could do that ha?🙄 Terrible.It is also sad that you are trying so hard to justify your doings, but every normal functioning person can understand and see what was your first intention, and can understand the game behind it.Long story short, kitchen is beautiful, but definitely do not buy it at Ikea!"

THATS NOT NEWS. This was established a month ago.So her suggestion, choose a new table and pay more if it costs more.I chose my table and paid for matching chairs and now her frankly stupid suggestion to chose another is, I repeat, quite stupid, for two reasons.1 Pretty much every other table they have is OUT OF STOCK that might in some way be considered even partially close to mine.And2 I chose that table and the matching chairs because they MATCH.Its like going into a tailors and asking for a suit and choosing shall we say a rather nice tweed and then when you go to pick it up they say we have no tweed trousers but we do have corduroy.Some how Ikea customer service are having a bit of difficulty grasping this obvious problem.And to add insult to injury they made this suggestion of picking a different table 7 days ago and they have still not replied to my email in response to their suggestion.I will keep you posted"

They had shrink way more than the 4% shrinkage said on the package and did not fit our windows anymore. After having read the return policy on their website, we decided to return the curtains. At the return section, I was shamed for having washed the curtains and trying to return them. The lady that worked that there day was vile. I’ve never seen someone so angry at customers for no valid reason. We were shocked when she threw my stuff on the side and told me « Ugh, it smells like soap and you want us to take it back? » and went on to shame us and show attitude. We stayed polite and in shock and left. After that incident, I decided to chat with their customer service and I was told that the return policy is decided by each store and each person at the counter basically so they override the official policy. I’m never returning there and will file a customer protection complaint to the authorities. Their stuff is expensive and really really poor quality. Save yourself the time and money and choose any other home goods store around you. It’ll also save you from the cheap cardboard cookie cutter home decor we’ve seen around for way too long."

  "articleText": "I just spent £1713 in-store on eight different storage cabinets on 10th June. The sales person writing up the order on the sales floor was not very knowledgeable about the products and had a \"could care less\" attitude. The Order Confirmation I received by email had 22 items listed; impossible for the untrained eye to make any sense of it or to identify the 8 pieces of furniture. After the check out I went to the \"TaskRabbit\" desk to book a \"specialist\" to come and assemble the 8 pieces the following week. They had no clue how to read the Order Confirmation and thus how to interpret my purchase and how to identify the 8 finished pieces in order to price the job. I gave up and made my own arrangements for the assembly.I made it very clear that the delivery had to be made to a church which is open only from 11am to 4pm Mon to Fri. Surprise: the delivery van arrived at 9am and of course could not unload. I phoned customer service but was told they could not contact the driver!! \"It's all done electronically\" they told me. So much for 'personal' service.In the end we got delivery the following day however one of the pieces (value £279) was badly damaged. I phoned customer service and was told that the piece could not be exchanged because there was no stock anywhere in the country to replace the damaged piece. We therefore agreed on a collection and full refund.I then was told that the first available collection date is 16th July with a refund to be made 7-10 working days thereafter. This means they will have my money for 43 days before I see the refund of £279.Bad experience all around!"

  "articleText": "Review on IKEA Nagasandra Bengaluru. The facility invited all members on 19th June, Sunday before official launch. We visited with excitement and discovered its a complete mismanaged and unlike professional staff in Hyderabad.1. After we entered the escalator stopped suddenly with jerk and my 3 year old kid fall down with injury. The staff saw and said sorry for the inconvenience caused rather than addressing the electrical fault or flagging the same (although she was holding a walkietalkie). We shared the concern to address the electrical fix so that other people dnt face the same but she was not bothered. Luckily we were moving up, if the escalator would have been stopped whilst moving down it would have been a big accident.2. We were invited on a particular time slot, but when we checked with other visitors it seems no one followed the time all dropped-in as per their time which created a chaos.3. Went to the food counter and the supervisor responsible to manage the que was continiously busy on his cell phone and chatting with another staff. Once entered the kitchen staff were also slow in serving and wondering how to cater. Few went inside to bring plates and returned after 10 mins by the time there were a long que linedup.4. Once we got the seat, looked for a microwave to warm the soup whic was been served almost cold, when asked the staff they replied the microwave is not working and to manage with the same soup.5. When went to coffee m/c the machine went off and no one bothered to address and was directed to another machine. None of the staff responds politely and all were so busy interacting among them self as of its a first job they got.6. While having food we discovered someone took away the trolley to keep back the plates, went to another staff and asked to share a trolley, and the staff responded in local language asking me to go and stand back into the que with anger.7. Went to furniture section to customise the wardrobe, there were 3 staff on table and all struggling with computer. After 15 min of wait to understand one person asked us to come back after 15 more min as the actual counter operator went on break.8. Improper sinages to exits. When checked with few security folks standing near fire exit as help showing the direction to exit, the security directed us to wrong direction showing entry inside. Finally few like minded other customer with family we came together and figured to exit outside.9. There are no mobile network found inside so if you leave behind your family member you cant reach them over phone.The complete setup and facility seemed messed up and unorganised with fresher non trained, non professional staffs. Only few overseas supervisor / management staff were roaming around and all were busy impressing them which was very clearly visible by all other customers as well.Its a complete mismanagement and bitter experience. Hyderabad and Mumbai IKEA is very nicely managed with professional staff. Electrical safety is also a concern where we observed many open cables laid down.Best wishes to IKEA bangalore with such non professional staff and mismanaged crowd."

  "articleTitle": "An amusing tale from a 3rd world country ikea store :)",
  "articleText": "As you can guess from the title I'm an extremely happy customer, who needs to share with you the unbelievable  experience of buying a kitchen from your franchise in Bulgaria.I've been Ikea's happy customer for over 10 years, so I endured patiently 30 days till the first available date at the store to order my dream kitchen. The big smile on my face disappeared when the kitchen department employee told me the kitchen design I created in your online tool (great app by the way) can't be ordered as the doors are discontinued, despite they appear on the site... So he made a new design for me but warned me I can order it only after I make another appointment after (you guessed it) 30 days :)So 60 days into my life with 2 toddlers and no kitchen, I headed to the store with a sense of relief. Only to find out that the new design uses doors that are not currently available and nobody can tell me when they'll be available... But luckily (I thought so at the time) I asked about my previous design with the discontinued doors and a miracle happened - they somehow had them in store despite staff told me they were long gone and discontinued a month ago :) All with a bit of a catch dough - few other bits and pieces were missing, but i was assured this is quite temporary and i should have it all in no time. So I took all that was available and filled my living room with boxes.So life goes on without a kitchen but with lots of boxes. My kids were quite thrilled by the situation. Turns out they are quite inventive and able to think out-of-the-box (and in- and around-the-box)  :) Downside - found out my medical insurance is not so comprehensive as I thought...2 months later I start getting nervous as my 60 days return guarantee runs out and I still don't have the kitchen I could return and get full refund for :) I start calling customer service asking for at least some probable delivery date - no luck.Another 2 weeks and my phone beeps joyfully - customer service notification to go to the store and collect my order. Yupeeee!!! Going there, giving my order documents and almost kissing the lady at order collection. But she is not smiling - \"hm, there must be some kind of mistake, your order is not here, you got wrong notification... We still have no idea when we'll have it\". Dreams of home-cooked meals shuttered, plastic plate home deliveries continued (hey, I already know all the delivery guys in the neighbourhood by name)!Another week goes by and another notification comes - half-tired, half-excited I go to the store. Guess what - my order is not there, it's wrong message! Seriously?!?Few days and notification again. Hmm... Another message in 1 hour - \"don't come, we probably sent you wrong message\"?!? Huh? I go online and check the items in the online store - they are now available there! They should have mine delivered if they sell them online now. I go there of course, can't stand the sight of my half-build, half-boxed kitchen anymore! The mistake is a mistake - my order is still in Neverland and the items in the online store are not really available,  just says so on the site. I'm depressed and decide to do some shoppong therapy - hey, this is genius, you treat your clients like s*#t and maximizer your profits at the same time :)After a nervous breakdown I decide to dismantle it all and bring it back to the store. But my conscience stops me - I'm a sustainability activist and can't scrap half-a-forest worth of material... Damn!I decide to be reasonable - calling once a week to check status of order and carry on with pizza and Chinese. Until I got a call from customer service last week - \"Hello, you ordered something a while ago and collected it, but we never formally closed the order. I just call to see if all is OK.\" NO, IT'S NOT OK!!! NOTHING IS OK!!! Lady on the phone is very sympathetic and promises she'll fix it all, I'll get most of the remaining bits in 6 days the latest and the rest - in 10.Right. Should have known better. A week later, my phone is silent. I call again - \"we actually have 10 of those in the store, so you can come and collect your 4 items\". Excited? Relieved? Happy? Of course not - my order is not ready and they don't have the items in the store as customer service told me :p I NEED TO SPEAK TO A MANAGER, PLEASE! Frowning lady comes over, no \"Hello, I'm...\", no \"Terribly sorry for the inconvenience\", just \"We can't guarantee you a delivery, it's logistics you know. Other people are also waiting. Check in 3 days.\" Right... Amazing customer service!Shopping therapy doesn't help anymore, I need professional help. Turns out my medical insurance doesn't cover \"nervous breakdown after shopping in Ikea\"... So I do what I can - going online and start writing to save some other poor souls from slow painfull kitchen dream death.True story!"

Most of the items we wanted were not in stock and I understand there have been supply issues, however it wasn’t a good start. Once we were able to figure out a few options there were some items that could not be picked up but had to be delivered. Of course there is a delivery fee to have the pleasure of picking it up. The real in convenience is after you go through that entire store, make the mental gymnastics to figure out what you can actually buy, you have to wait another 45minutes - 1 hours for the employees to gather your order. Such a pain. It wasn’t efficient and didn’t save us or the store any time. My days of shopping at IKEA are over."

  "articleTitle": "Unreliable and order messed up",
  "articleText": "I ventured yesterday for the first time to IKEA´s new branch in Hammersmith, as it is local to me, where I ordered and paid for a white dining chair as a birthday treat to myself, to go with my office desk. I wanted it in Mustard Yellow, as it was on display at their store, but they said it was no longer in stock for delivery to their Hammersmith branch (in that case, I am not sure why they have it on display as some stores still appear to have it online and after all, Hammersmith is more of a collection store). But to get back to the point, I bought the Broringe white underframe and the Leifarne seat shell and was told to go the next day, which is today, first thing in the morning to collect it, as it would be delivered to their store overnight. I was there on the dot but when I went to the collection desk I was told that only the underframe had arrived and not the seat shell, but that I would be receiving a text later in the day and should then return to the branch to collect.  Instead I got a call towards the close of business, only to be told there had been a mix-up and that it was not going to be available for pick-up ever at the Hammersmith Branch, so instead they had arranged to have it delivered as a favour to my home address on Tuesday 14th, without first checking to see if the day and time were suitable. It turns out I will not be around that day,  I will be away on work, they should have checked with me first, I would have preferred that an effort had been made to have it delivered to their store, but that was not an option for them. So, I asked if I could go to the Hammersmith store for a refund, they said NO, as they had arranged to have it delivered and that I needed to call customer service for that.  I rang customer service and asked them for a refund, after which I received an email from IKEA to confirm that my order was successfully cancelled and that I would receive a refund within 14 days, but as the order number in their email was different to that on my receipt, I had to call again to verify. This has been time consuming for me and not dealt with professionally by IKEA, they should have found a solution to compensate for their mix-up and have taken more of an interest. Generally, I do not feel they were remotely bothered, let alone concerned with customer satisfaction. So, my personal experience with IKEA's new branch at  Hammersmith, is one of unreliability.  I now have to wait for my refund, before ordering from another store and then I am not sure what I will be charged for the delivery of just one chair, when there is a branch so close to me. Moreover, I will not receive it in time for my birthday.  Overall a disapointment, let's hope I do not have to chase up the refund."

No, is this convenient for you, no just that we don't care about your schedule, you don't matter. Then on the new scheduled day they don't show up again. Just another text after waiting all day that it had been rescheduled. A call to ikea netted first, can't find the order by name and order number have to give them the delivery address, delivery city, delivery state, delivery zip code then my email then my phone number all just to waste time. I asked to talk to a supervisor and go thru the same thing all over. Its a very disjointed calls, give an answer the person is silent long enough that you think the call is disconnected, constantly thinking are you there? Told me they would send an email to the delivery to come the next day. Waited all day, again no show. Then get an email that i had to contact ikea for redelivery (wait on hold waste time again) or my order would be cancelled.

Goods not received. No notification received or any communication whatsoever from IKEA.I obviously rang Customer Services at 7pm, who advised me that all deliveries were delayed and all customers were informed. I most definitely was not, otherwise I would not have wasted a day of my life just waiting!!As a goodwill gesture the CS agent offered me a voucher and was very professional and empathetic. Here I am still waiting for my ikea delivery, day 2.Absolutely unacceptable that customers were not simply informed of the delivery delays, there is no excuse for this,  a simple text would suffice!UPDATE... my products arrived but two items were missing, which apparently had been damaged in transit from Dublin to Cork.Delivery of these items is now Friday and I will not be informed of the delivery slot until the actual day, which means another wasted day and having to cancel important commitments. So my delivery from ikea has evolved into 3 days of my precious time spent waiting.Absolutely appalling customer service from IKEA. I'm a very dissatisfied customer right now ikea. I should also add that I was cut off via telephone by 2 customer service agents in separate incidents. I was polite and pleasant. Perhaps once they realise its a complaint they hit the cut off button!!Extremely poor service in general"

  "articleText": "I ordered a high chair a few days ago. It was better pricing than Amazon, or so I thought. $25 plus shipping and tax came out to about $32. The estimated delivery date was today, may 30, Monday. I got an email saying it will be here today by 5pm, and then a text saying it would be here today by 9pm. (?) When I checked the tracking from my original email thanking me for my purchase, it said it won't be here for another 2 days! I called the customer service line and the first lady was apologetic, saying it was coming from FedEx, and she's not sure why, but the order was only just completed today. I asked her the reason and she didn't know. I asked her if I can get a discount for the wait and inconvenience and she transferred me to someone else, saying it was possible to get a discount. The second lady I spoke to was unapologetic and condescending, saying they don't offer discounts for delivery issues, even though it's their fault that the order was only just completed today, on the estimated delivery date. They took no accountability and I am still waiting for my highchair. Amazon would have refunded me my order right now even if I still got the highchair because it is past the expected delivery date. Ikea needs to take accountability."

The assistant checked me in and I waited 15 minutes to be told they didnt have my item. There was no proper explanation or apology. They just said the email that I got was automated and was incorrect, very odd even although their email said it was ready to pick up and timebound. I was told by the customer support that I would recieve another email. I then spent all day in Aberdeen and no email arrived and the tracking showed that it had been picked up already. I went back to the store again before closing time and the assistant re-checked and said that It may have arrived in the afternoon but was unsure. I waited again and then eventually the item rolled out, but no email ever informed me or they acknowledged issues. All I can say is very poor logistics tracking and inefficient customer support. I was not happy as I wasted a lot of time with this run around fiasco. Customer service was non existant. The single assistant on duty simply said this happens sometimes and we don't know what is going on. Not acceptable, the opposite of efficient and curteous !"

The agents are curt, and repeatedly ask for a receipt after you've explained you lost it. All items defective or not require a receipt. And if you produce a receipt they insist on a comprehensive backstory explain a damaged product even when you found the damage after you left the store.A far cry from the first 5 years of Ikea.... go to Target."

Received an email that they could not deliver it on 24/05, because the name on the address was different from the name of the person who paid. Did not ring the doorbell at all and drove off with the closet. Customer service angrily hung up the phone after I call for an explanation. IKEA does not want to deliver the closet anymore and refunds the money. 2 weeks of waiting because these people cannot think for themselves. The problem is that I already have one of these closets and I need a second one, this one in Germany was the last one available.

  "articleText": "Just spent a small fortune over the last month or so on numerous visits to Ikea. Have just sat for over an hour on the M6 in traffic to get to Wednesbury Ikea, to obtain a refund or credit note on a few items and to buy more in store. Unfortunately, the receipts I had taken did not have one of the items I was returning on them it (my mistake, but they are almost indecipherable...) and the store refused to even give me a credit note, even though they could see I had been a good customer recently and spending healthy amounts in store. I was asked if I had an Ikea family card as they may be able to identify the purchase. I gave them my card and they said they could not see the item on the listed sales. I asked to speak to a manager and instead got a completely bored youth who flat out refused to give me a credit note, even given the fact I will have spent more in petrol getting to and from the store than the £12 it cost for the  drawer organiser I was returning. I had to walk away with no return note, and I didn't bother shopping in the store I was so furious.I set off on the long journey home, and when I got back I identified the various purchase from my bank account but as one of the purchases was in excess of £240 it wasn't clear how they could attribute the sale to a total amount. I rang customer services who was able to pull up the receipt on her computer and email me a copy. On the receipt was the item I had taken back for a refund, and, my Ikea family card number. So, the bored sales assistant and rubbish 'manager' had failed to spot it when they allegedly looked up my spending history today, wasting my time and money as this will now necessitate a return trip which will take another 2 hrs out of my precious weekend. What AWFUL service! I certainly will not be giving them my business again. People lose receipts sometimes or mistakenly bring along the wrong one. A little helpful flexibility would be good, most stores operate a credit note policy, but not the mighty Ikea. You certainly wouldn't have been out of pocket, but you have now lost a good customer."

They WILL NOT deliver to our area and WILL NOT let you pay for an item over the phone and then go pick it up.  They touted \"first come first served\" which is bologna!!!  So, we called the home office, asked if we could pay online - NO was their answer.  You have to go there in person.  I told them it was a 4 hour round trip and I would gladly pay over the phone to assure it was there when we went.  They refused.  Fast forward, drive all the way down there, Paramus, and were told \"No, we have none!\"  even though I was told they did.  They looked on their computer and told us there were 8 available in Elizabeth store.  Drove ANOTHER 25 minutes away, only to be told once again, nope, none in stock!!!  A waste of 5 hours, a lot of gas and frustrated as hell.  I have never heard of not being able to call the local stores, what the heck???? So, we are out time, money and patience.  Save the aggravation and shop elsewhere.  This company has no idea what \"customer service\" is nor do they have the common sense to practice retail store etiquette by having their ducks in a row!"

The inspector says all is fine, it can only be a defect on the sofa. IKEA says, it is your own fault. We off cause expect that the sofa is to be used for sitting in, without breaking, which is what we have done.The customer support at IKEA is so bad. It is unbelievable.

Bianca's suggestion was literally \" you can do anything you want with it\"... Seriously? It takes up a lot of space, and disposing of it means driving to the recycling center since it's metal. They would not take it back, nor even consider a partial refund for the total disservice and nuisance caused to the customer. I strongly recommend to go physically to shops and to refrain from using their delivery service, which is extremely poor. And it saves you from having a rather unpleasant experience with the customer service."

  "articleText": "A week after ordering my items online, I got an email to say that one part of the set was out of stock. This meant that I'd have to cancel the whole order because my decoration plan required all the pieces. I contacted a chat agent for help. She said I'd have to call Fed Ex for them to cancel my delivery in order for me to receive a refund. I called Fed Ex and they said that they had not yet received the package, so I would have to call back Ikea to cancel it. I wrote to another chat agent who also did not resolve my issue and ended the conversation too early. I then phoned the customer service line. They explained that I would have to wait further until Fed Ex posted my order before they could issue my refund. I was very frustrated at this point that I was still being asked by Ikea to do more administrative work for Ikea's mistake, just to get my refund. Ikea really should have asked my permission before processing my order without a key component. The worst part is, that in my third attempt to try to get Ikea to issue my refund and to handle the delivery return with Fed Ex on their end instead of mine, the phone agent actually hung up on me! Never in my life have I experienced such treatment from a customer service agent. Shocked and very disappointed with Ikea."

  "articleText": "We last evening ordered x2 shelving units on line from IKEA Dublin.The order was confirmed by email, but a second email arrived a few minutes later which said 'we are unable to process your order. Please contact your bank for more information.'This despite the account being in good order.Presuming a technical glitch we immediately phoned IKEA service hoping to sort the problem out.They advised putting a repeat order through and sent a payment link. We paid a second time using the second card on the account only for the same to happen.Checking afterwards (service was by then closed) we found that despite the cancellation of both orders our account had been debited for them. (x2 @ €150 = €300)The account is still down this amount as of now. (the late afternoon of the following day)We phoned service this morning to request assistance only to unacceptably be told that it was a matter between ourselves and the bank.'Computer it say....'The agent insisted that they had not received the money, and that it would likely be refunded by the bank within 24 - 48hrs.The former may well be the case - and our bank could well have been at fault in the first instance but the fact is that we placed the orders with IKEA and our account was as a result debited for both payments.They consequently had and have a clear responsibility to engage with the bank to ensure that the matter is promptly sorted out.Also to with the bank resolve whatever systems glitch it was that permitted the debit to our account before the transactions were cleared. (if indeed it was a glitch - these systems seem always to be set up to benefit the businesses concerned)It's a significant matter. Even presuming its rapid sorting out somebody took the use of our money.What about the case of the person on a tight budget with e.g. standing orders to be met?The icing on the cake came when she (the agent) dropped the phone on us while we were (firmly but politely) explaining that her refusal to help was unacceptable....UPDATE x3 DAYS LATER. IKEA 'service' has since twice admitted that the problem was technical and on their side, and that it had been around for some days.Why then if they knew this did the agent trigger a second debit of our account by advising that she put the order through a second time?The bank meanwhile says that they can't refund without an instruction from IKEA quoting a code the bank gave us. IKEA say they don't do that, that it's automatic - and that it won't be sorted until their systems problem is resolved.They meanwhile sent duplicate email stock order cancellation confirmations  - this time suggesting that it could take up to 14 days for the refund to be processed. (?????)The agent when tackled on the 14 days claimed that it was only a stock message, that it should be sorted in days.What a mess...UPDATE X4 DAYS Later. The €300 was back in the bank account this morning which is a relief given a previous experience where it took months to get a refund paid.This doesn't detract from the reality of the uhelpful, ineffective and inappropriate handling of the matter by support - and the fact that the account should never have been debited in the first place...."

  "articleTitle": "TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE CROYDON STORE",
  "articleText": "During a visit to the Croydon Store on 30 April 2022, after completing a purchase of over £700 accompanied by my sister, we took our paid for goods (some in trolleys and used two baskets) and went to sit by the area of collection for a chair we were waiting for. We had a lot of items and put some items in 2 baskets to help us move the items to the sitting area whilst we waited. A security guard came over and \"told us\" we had to take our items out of the baskets and that we could not take the shopping baskets out of the store. I advised him that was fine and that we were not leaving the store and would return the shopping baskets to the designated area (we had spent almost 5 hours instore finding our purchases and were extremely tired). I front of other shoppers sitting in the area, he stated no we could not and should do it right away. When we advised him again that we would take the baskets back before leaving he started to raise his voice saying \"no you must take your things out of the bag now and return them\" I reiterated that we were not in any way leaving the store as we had to wait for our chair to be brought out to us and were also awaiting a taxi we had ordered. This infuriated him and followed a barrage of arguing with us loudly in front of other shoppers. He then proceeded to leave and returned with another store employee who began to shout at us for not returning the baskets as we had been told. Again we reiterated that we were not intending to leave the store and would return the baskets. The store employee became verbally aggressive shouting at us loudly in front of the other customers which then led to us feeling really embarrassed at how were being treated, especially as were had spent several hours in the store and were extremely exhausted and the thought that the security guard and store employee were both treating us as if we had committed an offence. This caused us great distress on a day that had so far gone well and we were excited with our new purchases, this made what was supposed to be an enjoyable trip to IKEA one of our worst experiences. I have never had this type of treatment when I have visited IKEA before and am still appalled at our treatment. My sister who had accompanied me so I could buy my items was also horrified especially after I had been praising IKEA. This behaviour from staff should not be allowed or encouraged. Treating customers in this manner is totally unacceptable, I will not recommend anyone to visit the Croydon store and will be leaving a strong message on google and trusted websites to make other customers aware of this disgusting treatment of customers. I hope you will look into this incident seriously and look forward to your feedback."

I guess the boss at IKEA has no bargaining power to deal with their delivery team.Originally I bought nine products at IKEA Manchester in store on April 19th and I scheduled the delivery due on April 20th.On April 20th, nobody came. No one called me either. Then they shoot me a SMS, it says my postcode has an issue. (No, it isn't. I had other companies delivered sofa and furniture to my address successfully using my postcode.) They made up this excuse and rescheduled the delivery date to April 23th.On April 23th morning at 9ish, I used their online chat and asked my delivery status. They said they were due by 17:30. Again at around 13:30, I enquired my delivery status again. They said the delivery was received at nearest hub. The hub had not put it on route yet. They contacted the hub and had not received any feedback and had to leave them a message to contact me. At the end, no one called and came at all.At this point I am going to get a refund and cancel the whole order. I don't wanna tangle with them and I just won't be their customer anymore."

  "articleText": "I placed an order online on 13th December 2021 and received notification that the product would be delivered on the 18th December.  However, not only did my item not show up, I was unable to chase it via customer services as the phone lines were not being answered and the online help said it couldn't help!  4 months later and no contact from Ikea whatsoever to explain the delay, I still had no item but they still had my money.  I managed to finally speak to a human being on the phone to cancel the order and get my money back, but was told their systems were down and to try again another time!  The online help \"bot\" stated it couldn't help me either, but at least it did eventually get me through to a human being.  She managed to cancel the order and I received a refund a couple of days later.  Shocking service all round from Ikea and I will never use them again - either online or instore."

  "articleText": "Have discovered the new \"Buy Back\" scheme they have introduced without honestly informing their customers.  Bought walk in wardrobe shelving compilation 29 January and was delayed in install until 04 April due to builder delay in completion.  When I return a small part of the multi buy items they told me I had used it.  It was only partially assembled with no inner shelves as it became clear at that point it would not fit.  But they insisted I had \"used\" it and only paid me 40% of its value as a buy back.  So the 365 return policy no longer exists really- No signs advising - really atrocious behaviour of staff on the day when I queried it.  I could take it back if I did not like it.  Wrote to manager of store and did not even get a response.  Buyers beware - policy change with no fair notification."

I then used their customer service query search. Did not recognise my query, which I reworded numerous times but it just was not recognised.When I eventually found their number, and got through to a human the only things they could say was “no worries”.I was then out through to the resolution centre who also liked the phrase “no worries”. We’re I was informed that a ticket needed to be raised as the I.T. Department were unaware of this problem.I had already explained that I had been on a forum with hundreds of people experiencing the same issues as me and this went back to March 2020.So if IKEA are unaware of this issue and after two years still not doing anything to resolve it then I’ll take my custom elsewhere."

So, one week ago I called and they said that CTT located the package and will be returned to ikea, and only when it is received in the store that they will refund me. I found out today that the whole thing is a lie, CTT never responded and never located the item, and ikea still insists that I should wait until the item is returned to them, an item that never received.The whole process is a joke, the package obviously will never be found but they continue on insisting that I should wait. I never received the package, so I should get my money back no matter what, right? Wrong!!! That’s not how IKEA works.. disappointing and shocking the lies that they gave me."

As I had many other estate issues going on and only was in in Germany for a few weeks it turned out the time IKEA required was not enough time-so I had to gift it to somebody instead of returning - 700Euros lost. I swore I’d never buy from these people again. Sadly, I did not follow my own advise  and bought something from IKEA again. 50% success-in a way. I received two out of four ordered items. The other two were never delivered. AND of the 4 packages delivered two were not mine and I was just told to donate/trash them. Talking about IKEA saving the environment!!!"

First time they called me at 12. I didn´t pick up, and they showed up at 12:30. I looked at his delivery instructions and it said 14-21. He didn´t care. The next one called me at 1 pm. I picked up thinking he wanted to confirm the appointment between 2 and 9. No! He said he´s 5 minutes from my place so he wanted to come right now. I was in the middle of a meeting, so I declined. I said I would only accept the delivery after 2 pm. The last one, today, came at 10:30!!! I had just gone to sleep a few hours earlier and had no idea what time it was. I asked him whether it was already 2 pm and he answered that he called half an hour ago (?!? why would he call me at 10 am, if my delivery is for 2pm at the earliest). I said that I booked the delivery between 2 and 9 pm and that this is not OK. He said (in German) \"Either you take this now, or I´m sending this back to where it came from.\" Given no choice I said that since he already woke me up, he can also bring it upstairs now, but he took the delivery and walked away. His colleague was puzzled by this behaviour as well, but he just shrugged his shoulders and they left. Needles to say, I had to call IKEA service to learn that my delivery booked between 2 and 9 pm will not come today at all. This is HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE service. These people do as they please, abuse your phone number calling you at whatever time they want and deliver goods whenever they want. AVOID at all costs. It´s better to rent a car or van and do it yourself than to be subject to this kind of abuse."

I did not trust Ikea to pick them up and give me the correct refund.Installer came back...still missing pieces, cupboard doors, drawers for most of the cabinets etc and I had given them exact measurements for my farm house sink and they had sent wrong sink cabinet doors so there was no way the sink would fit.I went back to Ikea with pictures of installers measurements as to what I still needed.

  "articleTitle": "IKEA double carbon footprint & double price policy!",
  "articleText": "Just ordered £500+ of furniture from ikea including 2 chairs which were showing as available for online delivery. On payment a message popped up saying only 1 chair available. Annoyed but went ahead with the order - delivery charge of £40. Checked online 2 mins after placing the order, and to my surprise, chairs again showing as available for delivery. So I phoned ikea asking for a 2nd chair to be added to my initial order. After being passed around, I was told stocks were low so it's a \"1 chair per order\" policy - but that I could indeed order a 2nd chair which would be delivered separately for an additional £40 delivery cost to me. I pointed out how crazy this would be as it would double the delivery footprint as well as doubling the cost of the chair (£45), but despite the customer service person talking to a supervisor, the advice remained the only way to obtain 2 chairs was to make a double order! To add insult to injury, as I felt disgusted by the whole discussion, I asked for the entire order to be cancelled, only to be told I'd have to wait 10 to 14 days to receive my money :-("

  "articleTitle": "Shocking! Avoid at all costs!!",
  "articleText": "So far Ikea has failed at the following;- all items were in stock at time of order (I remember this because the things that were not in stock I removed from the order).- they failed to deliver my order on the 5th March because Ikea had sold part of our order which had already been paid for.- they then failed to contact us to let us know there was going to be no delivery.- after all that hassle, the out of stock items were split from the order and the “in stock” items were set to be delivered on 8th March. I was told I had to call back to arrange the delivery of the out of stock items. (Great service!)- 8th March I phoned Ikea after you failed to give me my 4 hour time slot. I was told “your 4 hour window is 09:30 until 13:30”At 14:00 when guess what? Ikea failed to deliver again. I called again to be told…. I can’t help you can you call back in an hour???? (Really???) so at 15:00 I called back to be told “part of your order is out of stock (a different part) so it has not been picked to be delivered” so failed delivery and again no contact!At this point I am losing the will to live so I request a refund and I point out that the order has been split, so that’s £749 in total which is £449 for current delivery and £300 for the out of stock doors.- we get one email saying £449 is being refunded. I call back and ask for confirmation that the £300 is also getting refunded. That apparently can’t be done?? I tell them I am concerned that the £300 is not going to get refunded and I’m told it definitely will.- guess what? £449 has been refunded and not the £300…. I call AGAIN On the 10th to explain my concern had happened and they haven’t done as they said. Im told it was stuck and has now been pushed through….. we are still waiting and it’s now 17th so I have very little confidence that Ikea have done this.I have requested a managers contact information 5 times and been denied. Which is fair enough, however Ikea team members clearly are not “equipped to resolve my complaint” as it’s now 9 days later, it’s not resolved and Ikea still owe us £300.Which we have just been informed is still not authorised despite being told it was “pushed through” a week ago!"

Where as well as missing items I also had other items meant for other people.Ikea customer service absolve themselves of responsibility saying it is the delivery company side-stepping the fact that it is Ikea their customers are buying from and paying. Until they change that attitude (or their fulfilment partner) you're going to see very little improvement.Make the delivery guys wait whilst you check you have everything before you sign for delivery is my recommendation."

A simple task but done with care and kindness towards the customer and I don't want that to go unnoticed. There was meant to be a customer satisfaction survey at the end of the call, but the call dropped unexpectedly. So here is my review: 5 stars for Claire!"

I went to IKEA at Tempe 12/3/22 and the manager at customer Service just didn’t want anything to do with me kept saying call the customer service line tried to tell him I had and I was kept on hold whilst trying to sort this. Thinking go in person I would have a person to talk to.What was worse was his attitude that it’s ok to take over $400 of peoples money and when I said you’re happy for me to put a bad a bad review he said go ahead do it and walked away and left the girl at the counter with me saying sorry. I would hate to honk how many people are being ripped offIf that’s what you train your managers or your company’s way of working with people IKEA really needs to get the morales rightI work in customer service and would be reprimanded if I had that tone and attitude just down right rude, unhelpful basically told it’s my fault. Sometimes people have things in their lives a bit of compassion and common sense would have been goodI will never buy anything from IKEA again. Check your gift return cards."

I got no answers as to what happened etc. I don't even really care about the delivery issue, it was the 8 times calling to get help. Two weeks later i get a new delivery date. All unacceptable!! After reading others experiences, I have a completely different view of Ikea. It's definitely not the old Ikea I heard good things about. Hopefully they figure it out before they go under. I don't care either way considering it's my LAST EVER, that is if I ever receive it, purchase from Ikea. They don't care about customers who actually make the business, then they don't need my business apparently. I told them about reviewing wherever possible to let others know, but they didn't care either."

I am safe here!So I sent lots of messages with 2 agents and detailed pictures showing the obvious sagging (with different angles and measurements) so that it was very clear to seeI was told twice the mattress isnt faulty and the 10 year gaurantee doesnt apply as its not faulty!...and I should get a mattress topper 😂I was warned by another customer in the same position IKEA ask you for all the details then dismiss your issue no matter what! they were right!So luckily I paid with Paypal and the faulty goods clause applies there, so I have opened up a full claim for a refund, I didnt want to do this but its only way forwardHopes this helps anyone who sees it, please pay by credit card or by Paypal, alternatively dont buy a Mattress at IKEA!"

  "articleText": "I had a custom kitchen table top made and used the Ikea's measurment company to make sure it fits perfectly. I had it delivered and installed and found out the sink and tap hole is placed wrong so you can't install the tap. I called customer service who said I can send them an email and they will review my case in 4-6 weeks. And in case they then make a new one I can then wait another 4-6 weeks to get that delivered. So looking at another 8-12 weeks without a kitchen not to mention the cost of the carpenter I have paid to install the table. If I could go back I would have picked somewhere else to buy my new kitchen!"

Ikea customer service seem reluctant to take ownership, blaming their service partners, which is true in my case.The delivery service provider that they use are a set of cowboys, they dont check what they are delivering and have no care for the customers property. I recieved 4 chairs instead of a cabin bed lol. Oh and a carpet cleaning session, thanks to the young deliver person trailing mud all the way through my home.This company was in such a rush, they didnt check the paperwork or delivery address, Im in Sheffield but the chairs delivered were clearly labelled to be delivered to Halifax. They just looked at me gone out when i said this isnt my order. This did get rectified but wasnt delivered to the room of choice as stipulated in the delivery info, just about got the mud off my light coloured carpet!This doesn't make Ikea immune because at the end of the day they're the ones who contract out to these.Think my complaint has been put under one of the many rugs ikea sell in store.It's funny how the big companies fail when things don't go right. Make their money and run scenario!"

  "articleText": "We had the worst possible customer experience from a business ever. We ordered some cupboards  and were given an expected delivery of 2 months. We didn’t mind this and so waited for the product. The day comes by (Friday) and we are told that the delivery will be made by their contractor ANC between 7am and 7pm. We received a message at 7pm saying it will be delivered in 40min. Two hours later and failed delivery. We then were asked to call ANC ourselves by IKEA and spent over 2 hours speaking with different people with no possibility to escalate. We received a call saying that Sunday would be possible for delivery and when we told them that Sunday’s don’t work, proceeded to say that the next available would be the following Sunday, we again told them Sundays don’t work and asked for a call from (ANC). Saturday no call or notification. Sunday we received a text at  9:41am saying our delivery will be made at 12-4pm (we can’t do Sundays). We organized our parents to be there at the last minute and arrived at 12:01pm. We had no access to our phones for a while and received a flurry of missed calls saying we missed our drop off. After calling the driver he said he arrived at 11:30am. After calling Ikea to share our experience there was nothing they were willing to do to resolve their (IKEA) and their contractors (ANC) incompetence. The best they could do is rebook for another Sunday 3 weeks down the line and charge us an extra delivery fee. After an hour on the phone they would only budge on the delivery fee and would not escalate the issue to any manger. We offered and asked other solutions of using other freight companies or Uber which they refused to acknowledge. Unfortunately when we hinted at a refund, they were only too obliging and was resolved in 2 min. So two months later and 2 days waiting for a delivery we have no place to store our clothes we are living out of suitcases. Good luck with your delivery"

  "articleText": "I have just wasted over half an hour with an IKEA customer service who provided an astonishingly low level of service and did so with an appallingly bad attitude.I have a large item that I paid for delivery of, I assembled it over almost four hours and it developed a fault. The item is very large and very heavy, and I was told to return it to a store. It is too big and there isn't a store in the city where I live.I was told it could not be collected and exchanged because the \"pandemic\" means that the service was suspended. The resumption of the service is at some unspecified date in the future. Absolutely no help at all.IKEA are still delivering online orders so they can deliver a replacement, they simply choose not to. Blaming the pandemic at such a late stage is pathetic.The agent tried to end the call several times and ended the call due to a lack of response as I was typing my response.IKEA, you should be embarrassed by the way you treat your customers, we are not an interruption of your work, we are the purpose of it.What appalled me most was that I was not asked what the nature of the fault was. I said I needed one part replacing and the agent said that that could not be done. The agent was simply determined not to help and only achieved and damaging the IKEA brand. A great result all round, not."

He told me he had to check the items delivered first and moaned about the difficult access and some items being heavy (which is why I asked for help upstairs!).I returned to my home office upstairs as I’m working from home. After 10 mins and all being quiet I went downstairs to find they’d cleared off. No checking of items with me nor help moving larger bedroom items upstairs. Not even a ‘we’ve finished cheerio’.I live on my own and there were two delivery chaps and it would have taken a few minutes to take the three larger units upstairs. But it was all too much trouble. And I paid for this!!Contrast with an Ottoman bed delivery from a local company and it shows IKEA’s customer service, particularly delivery service, for what it is. More like IKANT (be bothered) ."

  "articleText": "I visited the Croydon branch of IKEA to buy a chest of drawers. I chose the EKET range and purchased a 3-drawer unit in grey. Flat pack.We built the unit according to the instructions, which certainly weren't as clear as some of the other instructions I have followed when constructing previous units. We persevered. It took hours.Once built, we stood back to admire the finished product. Crooked, misaligned, wobbly.We returned to IKEA to ask for guidance. We were told by one of the people who build the units that we could bring the unit back and if they couldn't fix it, we would get a full refund.We brought the unit back to 'Customer Service'. Unfortunately, the customer service department were not too understanding.Straight away they informed us that they would NOT refund us as the unit was already built. They said they would try and realign it for us.We returned after an hour to find the unit sitting in the customer service area. Less misaligned but still ... misaligned.I pointed out that the unit wasn't fit for purpose as it was so crooked. I was told that I need to take it home and 'keep adjusting it until it lined up'. I pointed out that I had already spent hours trying to do just that.They stood firm and said there was nothing more they could do - they were NOT providing any refund.They offered a service whereby I could have someone come and realign it at my home - at an additional cost. This came with no guarantee that this was even achievable.What I want to know is why doesn't IKEA clearly give a WARNING on the front page of all instructions that once assembled, the item CANNOT be returned, even if it is malfunctioning. I was under the impression that the law in the UK was that you are entitled to a refund if something is not working / broken...I had to walk away with the malfunctioning unit.I was shocked at their coldness and determination not to even consider a refund or good will gesture of any kind. I know they are following orders and just doing their job - taking their orders from above.Those in charge at IKEA - please note - your so called customer service is appalling."

Apparently there were a few screws missing, probably from the start but we just never bothered to go back to get them. They couldn’t even tell me which screws were missing which makes me believe none of them were actually missing and I’ve asked if they had spare parts as they have a wall full of screws at the returns point but apparently they don’t have the same screws? What company doesn’t have their own screws to replace?! What if I brought a bed with me? Ikea shouldn’t advertise this on their website as clearly this is not what they want to do.

All cabinets, doors and accessories were ordered on December 3, 2021.  Most of the items were delivered with the following 2 weeks.  Unfortunately,  5 cabinet frames were out of stock.  I understand there is a global supply issue right now, bit it's very frustrating when you call Ikea customer service time and time again and they can provide NO information at all regarding the availability of the out of stock items.  This is 2022.  I cannot believe that a worldwide company like Ikea does not have a better production  and inventory management system.  So after 11 weeks, everything  was returned to Ikea.  This whole dreadful experience has cost ne a couple of hundred dollars from the initial shipping charges to renting a truck to return everything.  If you do order a kitchen from Ikea, before committing,  make sure all the required cabinets are in stock at that time.  Otherwise, look elsewhere."

I lost double that amount. And now they give me hard time getting my money back  so my account is more than 4000 dkk in minus due to their mistake and I don't hear from them. Thumps up for IKEA, or  not. 😡"

They give me the wrong box and I went to the store two time was a special vehicle ,they don't care!! .Bad service arrogant attitude.So I lost this piece of furniture and  lost my 2 days of work, that's not including the van that I use especially for this big furniture. Thank you IKEA and I hope you make more money by stealing other people ,thank you."

  "articleText": "I have an IKEA store credit card. I go to pay my bill on the due date, and there is a giant banner, stating they now have a 4pm deadline.... starting 2 weeks ago. Of course, everyone who sits down after work to pay their bill on their due date this month is going to be charged a late fee, and worse, an increased interest rate. What a sleezy, underhanded trick. Could you imagine playing a board game with the likes of these people? Rule change! I called and was able to have the late fee removed \"as a courtesy\", but that won't help the interest rate, which is clearly the intent. An ethical company would have given it's customers a 60 day notice for the 4pm deadline, so customers would see the change coming when they pay their bill the proceeding month. The fact that they didn't tells you the late fees and higher interest rates certainly are not an unintended consequence. They knew exactly what would happen. Ain't they slick. By the way, I have other credit cards that utilize the same bank, that don't have a time cut-off, so it absolutely is Ikea. I will never put another dime on their store card."

  "articleTitle": "My experience with IKEA has been a sham…",
  "articleText": "My experience with IKEA has been a sham from the start unfortunately.I have asked for my case to be escalated multiple times, only to find that you do not offer any kind of genuine customer journey. Instead you provide road blocks. As such I have now begun proceedings for small claims court and reported ikea to trading standards and the ombudsman which I’m currently waiting for an outcome.My journey started online with the Pax system designer only to find that your layouts default the size without warning and increased the car is size of the wardrobes to “239” which would not fit. You proceeded to deliver the wrong size and refused to cancel the second delivery even after I informed you of the problem.Unfortunately this was the beginning of my problems and though very courteous and I would like to stress very friendly and diligent, your customer service is horrifically under trained, disjointed and hopeless. They have no concept of how to resolve a complaint nor do they seem to understand your own systems with any competency. They arranged for a collection to take place (this was on the Sunday 30th) on the Friday from the Manchester store while they dropped off 2 new wardrobe carcasses from the same store as it wasn’t available from distribution.A delivery of more incorrect wardrobes took place on the Wednesday that you couldn’t cancel (not dispatched so how you can’t cancel baffles me). On the Thursday you delivered the first section of replacement wardrobes (I now had 8 wardrobes and 7 does plus internal scattered upstairs making it very difficult for us to move around and my pregnant partner had to climb over boxes). When delivered we realised you had now delivered the wrong depth of the wardrobe making the internals you had delivered useless not to mention still not what we ordered / wanted.Friday came and you had cancelled the delivery dues to stock but your CS staff told us the collection would continue (if did not as it was cancelled)When the weekend rolls round another complaint raised as I need the wardrobes out of my house and I have now discovered that most of what we had been sold online was actually discontinued back in October 2021. Baring in mind we have placed our order in late January 2022 I’m shocked this is a slick pant process. Past all the new complaints and subsequently finishing your CS to be polite yet in affective both in store and on the phone we have decided we can no longer try to find a resolution and make the wardrobes you deliver work (the second deeper set) we ask for all of the unit to be collected.Your drivers come out onTuesday, to our bemusement it is booked on two aerate collection on the same day…?This is where honestly I can’t forgive nor excuse the actions or issue with  try stock, the first set of driver arrive around 11:30am they inform me heavily pregnant partner they will not collect the boxes from the top of our stairs (straight 13 steps to the front door, no turns and where you placed the units and had collected them from perviously) my partner asks what they expect her to do about it as she is pregnant to only be told it’s not their problem and she best figure it out and bring them down the stairs. So fortunate for ourselves we had carpet fitters in our house on the same day that intervened and brought the stock they were willing to take out of the house. Too the credit of your second set of drivers later in the day they could not of been more apologetic and couldn’t understand the previous drivers comments or what two collections had been booked but collected the ray of the items.Though this has been a long journey already we aren’t finished yet, since the multiple calls as your staff don’t understand where £195 has gone between all the refunds, swap etc. we have still to receive a refund and though we once again have called tonight to try and resolve it so we can go into a store to try and sort wardrobes we are left without the fund that should of been returned to be able to do so. Only to top it off that this evening we were hung up and have received no email to update us in the situation after I sat on hold for 30 minutes, during my 18th call to yourselves totalling 13 hours in the last 2 weeks trying to fix your mess. Please respond and resolve your utterly abysmal service and business practices"

AL, the returns shift leader, has intercourse with the employees even though he is married and has a child. When Al was young he ran away from home and his parents considered him dead, threw away his belongings, and gave him a casket and head stone. His child isn’t really his, although he continues to take care of it while his “wife” sleeps with other people in front of him. That’s the kind of employees that are hired and the lifestyle that’s encouraged at this location. Save your friends, save your family, and stay away from this terrible ikea location that destroys lives and promotes discourse. I encourage you to never come back here again - Chris should be ashamed of himself for how he’s managed this location."

  "articleText": "Ordered a daybed and mattress for delivery. 7am on a Sunday morning there was banging at the door with the delivery. By the time we got down the stairs the driver had dumped the boxes in the street and driven off. Not even left a delivery note. Half the boxes for the bed didn’t arrive - 2 out of 3 boxes. Rang customer services immediately. Very helpful lady, got onto delivery team and assured us they would call back before lunchtime after speaking with the van driver to see if they have the other parts. This NEVER happened. They didn’t even bother to speak with the driver. Clearly they just never bothered to put the rest of the boxes on the van. We rang customer services back AGAIN at 3pm to enquire and that’s when we were told no idea where the rest of the goods are, no idea when it can be re delivered etc. requested a full refund and collection of the delivered boxes. Customer service agent specifically asked if we would like a morning or afternoon collection or our day of choosing. We specified afternoon. They came in the morning anyway!I’ve bought from IKEA for over 10 years and have never had a bad experience but this has put me off shopping online with them ever again. Whilst the customer service agents were helpful, they couldn’t tell me where the goods were or when I would get them. This really is not good enough when I’ve paid almost £400 and £40 for the delivery on top. I’m now £400 out of pocket, with no bed, and having to wait for a refund which will also take god knows how long!"

The cooker started turning itself off mid-cooking after a couple of years but we have a 5-year guarantee, they’ll fix or replace it and everything will be ok, right? WRONG!Firstly, the guarantee covers fixing it and NOT replacing it. Hotpoint will keep fixing it until your guarantee period runs out and then you will be left with a dud cooker that you have to keep paying to repair. In the meantime you will spend hours at home waiting for them to fix it...again (see below)Secondly, Hotpoint engineers are a nightmare to deal with. They don’t understand the cooker they are fixing. I was told the cooker was ‘just cooling itself down a bit’ when it was actually cool enough for me to put my hand on the inside of the oven. They order the wrong parts. One engineer didn’t turn up because he couldn’t find any parking and actually wrote that down as a reason for closing the repair case! They are an absolute joke!The cooker was not even that good to begin with, even when it was working - it cooks more on one side and is not very powerful.I will never buy a cooker from IKEA or Hotpoint again"

The way they do things seems completely stupid, if I order items online that are available then surely they should be then reserved for my order on my delivery date- well no they’re not. On the delivery day when they went to get my 17 items only 5 of them were available despite them knowing for 23 days they had to fulfil the order that I had paid for. That I had spent time saving for! And the only answer they have for this is they can re-order them and I’ll have to take another day off work and sit in the house waiting for another delivery in a weeks time, and the girl at customer services can’t even guarantee all the items will still be sent. Ive been told they might not be all in stock again on that date, so they will send what they have and I will have to call them again and re-order them again. I am speechless, how long is this going to go for. It’s not like it’s easy to get through to them as-well. Honestly pathetic. Don’t take a chance and give them your money, pick up in store if you need to. Looks like they take your money and hope you forget about it. They even sent me the dispatch notice on the morning saying all my items were being sent and in transit, if I hadn’t called them they would have left it. Worst of it all is I am sick so had arranged for someone to be here to help take delivery of my stuff today and assemble them, total waste of their time as well as mine. And now as I cleared out my room of my old sofa and countless other items I am now stuck sick as hell, sitting on the floor in my living room, with no guarantee I’ll even get my items if the rescheduled delivery date."

Secondly they can not find the missing part of my kitchen delivery. 5 plus phone calls to their customer service - no luck!Finally my kitchen is delivered, but the delivery crew handles the goods very roughly and the kitchen plate and sink is missing.The kitchen plate (which is 3,5mtr long) is then delivered wrongly at my home address and not the summerhouse.In addition I ordered 4 new beds. The delivery of these beds is a disgrace. The delivery crew did not call in advance. So they choose to dump 4 new beds like tilted dominos in my winter garden...! This the packaging obviously can not handled because it was just thrown off the back of the delivery van.To IKEA - get your processes together and please get a firm grip on your customer service."

I will never return, I said this a couple of years ago but I mistakenly thought things might be better after covid, I was completely wrong.

Lies or misinformation from customer service on the phone when trying to find out where our delivery driver is. Received tracking texts that were irrelevant. Told to stay in till 7pm despite delivery due at 10am. Suffice to say was not happy when it transpired delivery was NOT coming that day at all. Then after that it was late again, missing parts of sofas, damaged table and chair. More mess around from customer service. On and on. I only offer 2 stars instead of 1 as my furniture looks good now I've built it all and 1 agent, out of all those I've had to call and email, was very helpful. I will not be shopping there again, which is sometimes an empty threat from moaning old men but I'm an angry young(ish) woman who really means it."

Luckily I was in when they came, but one of the badly packed heavy items was out of its box and damaged.  Delivery company reluctantly accepted that the item would be returned.  Called Ikea to ask them to send a replacement but was told there was nothing they could do until the item was physically back with them.  They suggest it would be at least a week to get a replacement.  Having paid £15 delivery I'd expect them to get the return info from DPD and immediately order a replacement.   Failed online service for delivery date, poor packaging of heavy items, mistrustful customer 'service' - not what I'd expect from an international brand!"

When I got to the door it was locked and there was a sign on the door saying that they have \"Winter Hours\" and they close at 8pm during the winter. So ... within the window they game me to pick up my items, they were closed.I called customer service from the parking lot. I explained the situation to the woman who answered. She put me on hold for 6 minutes and then hung up.I called back. Someone else answered. I explained the situation and they hung up while I was speaking.I drove home and tried the chat. I chatted with a rep named Judith -- she chatted with me for quite a while and then told me there was nothing she could do and that should call the customer service number. When I told her I had already tried that, she told me to try the chat again in the morning and talk to the \"concern team.\" I will give this a try tomorrow, but am very skeptical that a \"concern team\" actually exists.

  "articleText": "I bought an IKEA kitchen, and sadly have had a terrible experience. In store service was fine, (although they should take more care when placing an order as there were extras in that we had asked to be removed) but the delivery / customer services were appalling.My booking was taken no problem but then the distribution team emailed saying parts were missing so they couldn't process it. For a few days after however I had the sales team calling telling me to pay for it. The third sales guy that called told me everything was now available and I should pay to reserve it so I did.You don't get contacted you just get emails with delivery dates booked sent to you, they don't check you can make the date or explain why you have several you just receive emails saying it's booked for delivery with no communication of install. There is no direct number to this team you have to email them but they never respond and if you call customer service they don't know what is happening. We received 2 delivery dates, one of which I am not in the country for so I rang the kitchen customer service team and asked then to change it. Instead she cancelled the whole order without asking at which point we lost our hold on the kitchen but did not know. They couldn't accommodate a simple date swap so in the end we had it rebooked for the same dates again. The installation guy was not notified instead he was texting me the customer for updates on our order due to lack of communication from IKEA.On the 23rd of December just before Xmas and 2 weeks before the majority of our kitchen was set to arrive we received an automated email saying our order had been cancelled and refunded. No forward warning no explanation. I called customer services who informed me they were missing some of our doors! So they have refunded us because they didn't have them but still intended on delivering the rest of the kitchen with no update on stock availability. When I asked what would happen the response I  got was you have to keep an eye out for them coming back on the website!! The customer has to actively look out for kitchen doors to match the kitchen ordered bearing in mind I hadn't received any info on what doors had actually been refunded either. Alternatively I could go in store and pick other doors. So now I am having a black kitchen delivered with 3 missing doors and I can pick some green ones instead, perfect!We went into store to complain who when looking at the account explained that the customer service lady who cancelled the order had in effect lost our doors. They were not surprised in fact they were used to it so this terrible delivery and customer service team that IKEA have is very much a known thing yet they do nothing about it. Our whole kitchen had to be cancelled 2 weeks before arrival and we spent Xmas searching for a new one and someone to install.We are still waiting on part of our refund 3 weeks later. We have had all the electrics and pipes changed to the IKEA spec as requested by the installation guy and now have to have it redone for the new kitchen, an expense IKEA was meant to pick up but heard nothing yet.It has been an awful experience, complicated and mis-informed from the start. The customer service team are by far one of the worst I have ever had to deal with and when you ask to talk to a manager they won't speak to you. We have completely lost faith in IKEA."

We bought among other items four wardrobes , at the order desk I asked for internal storage baskets but they were out of stock but I was encouraged to buy the runners for them as the baskets were due in “ a week”. I returned a week later then another couple of weeks later and so on.. this began last August 2021. I finally decided to change my planned wardrobe design in favour of shelves which were available. Shelves installed I returned to Ikea  with the basket runners as they were now no longer needed but. Ikea do not refund or give credit notes nor allow an exchange without proof of purchase ( receipt). Even though the items were still in their original wrapping.Let me conclude this with one completely accurate and heartfelt punchline .. IKEA’S CUSTOMER CARE STOPS AT THEIR FRONT DOOR. Ikea you’ll never see our face in your store again and I’ll promote this thought to anyone who’ll listen."

At time of delivery we asked if there was anythign to sign/review together like used to be the process and the delivery team told us 'no we don't do that anymore because of COVID.' Less than 5 minutes after they had left our house we realized the mistake and called the delivery team but they told us they weren't allowed to come pick up merchandise after drop off and we had to call the store. Called the store and they told us they were so understaffed that no one could handle support calls and we should call again the next day. Tried online chat and they said we needed to call the store. Called the store the next day and finally got someone who said we would have to drive the couch, which was a truckload of large boxes too heavy for us to carry and too large to fit in our cars, in order to get a refund. This is for THEIR mistake. We finally did a chargeback with our credit card company after going around in circles and getting no help for Ikea (all while our living room was filled with huge boxes for an unwanted couch and by the way, we had no couch because we had gotten our old one picked up for charity before the new couch's delivery) and Ikea send a HUGE packet of falsified 'documentation' about our case. Meaning they spent more time than they were willing to spend with us to resolve the issue to make sure they got their money back from our bank. I will never shop at Ikea again. We gave the couch away to a friend who paid for movers and a delivery truck and we are eating the cost."

What a shower of foolishness.  In between this they wanted to send bits of the delivery, eg draws for the bed, then the remaining items on differing dates. Obviously the order was cancelled and I was advised they would re credit the account within a couple of days.Since then, I have been lied to, kept on hold , told 3 times the money would arrive into my account and then asked two times during the Xmas period to call them, even though I’ve sent several emails made calls and requested Customer Services complaints to resolve this alongside furnishing them with my contact telephone details on every email which they already hold on my file.Today (5 January) I’m told for a fourth time after I have been asked again to ring them, I was sat on hold for 15mins (again), and asked to confirm my address and delivery address again for them to say they are transferring the refund now told and it would take a couple of days (3-5 days advised from a followup email from them).  I asked the payment processor to speak to the customer services manager and was put back in the hold que to speak to them, which I have not got half hour spare to do!So to this day, no formal apology, no investigation into any of my complaints, no followup and still no cash.  They are happy to cause hardship as they knew I had to buy these items from elsewhere.I need IKEA to experience my IKEA journey and for them to understand why I will NEVER SHOP WITH THEM AGAIN!I want my complaints investigating, I want my money including compensation, and I want IKEA to apologise to all the people they have wronged through this refund process which should take within 14 days, but to date this is nearly two months.Absolutely APPALLING!!!!!"

I reserved the product, but then my plans changed and I cancelled the order on time. 2) Some days later, I was surprised by IKEA asking me to pay the reservation costs of the cancelled order. I initially thought it is a mistake caused perhaps by excessive champaign and ignored that message. 3) Next message from IKEA adds the reminder costs and asks me to pay Euro 7.99 for the product I never purchased. My conclusion: avoid IKEA DELFT by all means, they are greedy and do not care about you or about their image."

SHAME ON YOU!"

  "articleText": "We bought a bed (or we thought we did!) from IKEA France in November. We had just moved into our house so unpacked it straightaway. We ordered a BROWN bed with drawers for 449 Euros. Imagine our surprise when we opened the boxes to discover IKEA had sent WHITE legs (the legs are also the wrong size) and WHITE drawers to go with our brown bed! I contacted them by chat as my French is still not great and the only option I was given, was to drive 90km to my nearest IKEA store with four huge boxes of bed parts to exchange it. Hang on a minute I said, this is your error, why should we drive nearly 200km and hire a van, to sort out your mistake? Read our returns policy they said! I have been shopping with IKEA for a long time both in the UK and now in France, and have to say this is absolutely shocking behaviour. You can't take money from people, send the wrong stuff and then roll your eyes and say read our returns policy. I have also contacted IKEA on Facebook, sent an email to their European CEO and contacted Resolver. I feel there is nothing I can do to get a replacement or, my money back. I will never shop in IKEA again, what a shame."

  "articleTitle": "Go get some popcorn dear reader because…",
  "articleText": "Go get some popcorn dear reader because this is going to be a long one.On 21st of October I stepped inside your store from Baneasa, Bucharest, Romania. I ordered at that time a bedroom. Or at least this is what I thought. The lady forgot to add a closet I am sure I mentioned, so when they delivered it, I figured out it was missing. 2 guys came during the next following days and they were able to assemble only the desk because the bed it turned to be broken and the closet, as I said, was missing. They gave me a changing paper, I sent the pictures to Ikea but they told me the bed was not in stock anymore so I have to wait. I waited because I really wanted that bed regarding the fact that the headboard was already assembled in my room. After a week they told me they still do not have it in stock and they asked me if I want to keep it broken or I want to keep waiting, so I kept it for a discount and rescheduled the assembling. In the meaning time I had to make some phone calls to schedule the assembling of the closet because for some reasons it seems like as long as I have an assembling team in my house already, they cannot do 2 pieces of furniture that are there. (so stupid policy by the way, YOU LOSE TOO THIS WAY. Time, gas, and you annoy customers a lot, for me that meant 2 days off instead of one for example). And because my life is not spinning around Ikea I took a day off and I waited for them. All the way to 8PM when they called to tell me they cannot make it that day but the next day I will be the first customer they serve. Anyway. The next day they came and surprise! They told me they do not assemble a broken bed and they left and I kept sleeping on the couch. (Despite Ikea had the pictures of the deffect and they knew the bed is broken, nobody told me they wont assemble it). They gave me another changing paper. After I tried to solve this through phone calls and online chat, and everyone told me there is nothing to do about it as long as I accepted the discount, I went to the store where they told me I have to wait until the bed is available again. Suprise! Now my problem can be solved. (Yes, I am saying that your call center and online chat is as useful as ”g” in lasagna).So this is how, dear reader, I waited a month and a half until the bed was available again. A whole month and a half of sleeping on the couch while having a payed bed. When it was finally available, I went to the store, I returned the discount and ordered it but guess what? I had to pick it up myself. At that exact moment because... God knows why! That lady just told me it is the right thing to do these days. And this is how me, myself and I (a 55 kg girl stuffed in 165 cm) with a small car left Ikea with a whole bed. And yes, I went all the way to the third floor too with it. AND I HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT BREAKING IT. When I arrived home, I had to call a team to pick up the broken one and I had to schedule another assembly team because, for some reasons, the lady from the store could not do it this time. First time it was possible... now no. (And btw probably you know what a phone call to Ikea means in December, yes... I waited 30 minutes every time until someone talked to me). They scheduled the assembly team again. After a week. Another day off. And exactly! They called again at 8 PM to tell me they wont arrive that day but the next day I will be the first customer. I was the first one indeed and guess what he told me? The guy who came to assemble my bed? ”You had a mattress, why didnt you sleep on it”?If I knew I have to face all this journey to be able to sleep as a normal human being, I would have chosen Dedeman in the first place. Today is 17th of December and I am going to sleep on a bed I payed 2 months ago for the first time. Who is going to pay for my days off taken for no reason and for my nights I slept on the couch? I am not a Karen and my patience has a mountain size, but Ikea you messed up every single step of my order. This was the first but definitelly the last time I interacted with this store. And I will make sure the ones around me know my journey in detail before buying your products. If you made it this far, thank you and I feel sorry you have to work in such place. Bye, I will go to sleep now because I have almost 60 nights to recover."

  "articleText": "I had a very bad experience with the third-party company that Ikea used for the delivery.  This company was supposed to deliver to my front door.  I will admit it is challenging to find parking but we contacted them to notify them there would be a challenge.  My son offered to meet them. Unfortunately, I was sick in bed.  They parked about 100 meters from the back of my building on another block.  They asked my 17-year-old to help them carry one of the Alex drawers that we ordered. They left him with a Karlby Countertop, two Alex Drawers.    to carry about 30 stairs by himself.  He is probably 120 lbs soaking wet,  the Karbly countertop weighs 88lbs give or take.  I had no idea this was happening as I was sick in bed, my son came back struggling out of breath and  sweating. He looked like he was going to pass out.  He said I almost fell down the stairs 4 times.   He also managed to drag  one of the Alex drawers up the stairs.  This was a birthday present for his 18th birthday and he could have been badly injured.  I have been in retail for over 28 years and this is absolutely unacceptable.  They use a 3rd party delivery company called 24 hour Metro.  All I was offered was a refund on my delivery charge and a $25 dollar gift card as an apology.  I contacted the call center and was not allowed to talk to any manager.  I know this is BS because I was a manager of a call center, there has to be someone in the escalation team.   Come on Ikea you can do better than that?   My son could have been very badly injured? Broken a leg, injured his back, or lying under the countertop.  Do you need pictures to see how steep the stair are?  To understand the gravity of the lack of customer service your 3rd party delivery did today.   The refund on the delivery fee and the gift card as an apology does not cut it for me.  File number 24466601."

I actually have to rent a car again, drive all the way, park the car, bring the first package, wait in line, and maybe, get a replacement package. Time and additional costs on me of course.

  "articleText": "Purchased a Hemnes chest of drawers in June, we had an absolute nightmare from the moment we tried to assemble it with holes not being drilled properly through to drawers not fitting together properly. After a week I noticed the top was denting and chipping ridiculously easily (bear in mind, its in a bedroom, I have no children and I am very careful with my furniture) and I also have one drawer which for no clear reason does not open or close correctly without catching, a relative who is a carpenter has looked at it and says the wood has not been seasoned correctly and cannot understand why the one drawer does not open or shut properly. I tried contacting Ikea various times to get this issue resolved, I recieved a reply via Facebook messenger but after I replied, silence. I left a comment on Ikea's facebook page and recieved a reply, but only after I left a comment which is very funny, is it not?I eventually got a resolution and a partial refund however I am totally dissatisfied with my chest of drawers and am left bitterly dissapointed with Ikea's idea of what customer service is, and I strongly urge anyone looking at the Hemnes chest of 8 drawers to just not bother full stop.Such a shame!"

Rang this number, operator was polite but unhelpful. Could not say if there was cctv coverage or not, unwilling to check if any existed unless requested by police to do so. Asked to speak with someone at the store, but in this era of advanced communication, this is not possible.I understand that parking is at my own risk. The only recognition that this was not the ideal IKEA shopping experience was an apology from security staff at the time, and then a reminder that parking is at my own risk from their central number.Shop at IKEA if you want to, but guard your vehicle.

  "articleText": "My husband, my two toddlers and myself went to Ikea tonight. Not busy at all and tons of workers standing around. We were at check out and they told us we couldn't buy 2 storage bins because we didn't have the lids. 1) we didn't know they came with lids 2) we didn't want them. Not only would they NOT allow us to buy them but 2 mgrs, Billy and Sarah, and loss prevention came to us and told us that we would have to go get them. Now we were tired, Ikea is a HUGE store, and they never once asked if they could quickly go get them for us. No lines at check out. 4 people telling us we couldn't buy something. Sooo we had to put everything back in our cart, go back through the store, find the lids and we were so upset. The little tiny sign that says we should get both parts was covered by one of the other advertised containers. When we finally got back up to check out, I went back to the mgr Sarah and said that I was so disappointed with their customer service approach which was, \"you either want it or you don't\" and \"that is our policy\" which were both solutions to our problems apparently, and she could only muster the effort to say \"Have a nice day\". My kids are hungry, mommy is so crushed. 4 people standing around could have saved our day and made our Thanksgiving one of gratitude. But instead I am writing this review hoping that America changes the way they \"take our money\". I will be reaching out to Keith, who I was told was the store mgr and for Billy?....You are a mature man who I hope would understand that having a family walk all the way back through the store for a lid when you have workers standing around is a straight up \"I don't really care\" attitude and it shows. Please tell me someone else has had a similar experience and it is making me question my faith in humanity."

The delivery guys would lie to me, not show me any invoice or confirm the number of boxes, but instead pass me to their boss and disappear. The CDS customer support was extremely aggressive and threatening and eventually all they said was that they are not responsible of anything. I was left after speaking with the Ikea customer support to check myself all 69 boxes and see what is missing.And this is only the beginning, still have 2 more deliveries to come and two other orders to eventually arrive in stores someplace, sometime.I could not believe that Ikea would contract such unprofessional and threatening companies such as CDS.I will avoid all together to ever get in an Ikea store just thinking about the awful delivery service."

  "articleText": "This has been a nightmare. I  had an Ikea kitchen designer help me design my kitchen before my major remodel on October 4. 2021.  wWe finalized the plan. I spent $8200.00 on my cabinets including parts, I paid extra to have all items delivered to my home. My shipment was to be delivered on November 17th, 2021. Of course it didn't arrive until the 18th. Once all items we inventoried many items were missing cabinets, doors, parts, and lighting. Several cabinets were damaged as well. Trying to reach someone that gives a damn is impossible, long wait times, disconnected calls, no return calls or emails. Now they are telling me that I have to pick up some items in Kansas, I live 3 hours from Ikea and other items will be shipped to the store and they will ship them FedEx to my home. This just keeps costing me money with the delays and the labor. Ikea offered me a 10% credit. No thanks to their offer. Ikea needs to be accountable for selling items to a customer that they don't have stock, this is fraud. I will be turning them into the District Attorney's office and let them explain to them. I am exhausted dealing with them. Beware buy your cabinets elsewhere."

Later when I was looking at another item ordered the parts were missing so then I had to order the parts and cannot fix this together until they arrive, they were never online to order for quite a while, also not available in store either probably why.

  "articleText": "Like so many others on this page I have sadly found IKEA's customer service simply appalling. Having spent literally hours both on the phone and on ( the completely soul destroying!) 'Chat', this utterly time wasting experience has been one of 'the' most frustrating shopping debacles I have ever encountered.  From an hours long wait to speak to a customer service representative, to the joy of dealing with the passive aggressive, rude attitude of the  'Chat' staff who obviously believe that it is their moral duty to remind us that we are living in 'unprecedented times' ....hence why IKEA's Customer Service can now be rubbish and, we the paying customers, should obviously be far more understanding of their failings and lack of training.                                                                         Telling customers they are wrong ( over & over again ) must also be part of 'Chat' training only for them to finally realise (30mins later) that actually ... the customer (me!) was in fact correct.  No apology needed obviously.                      The thought of having to deal with Customer Service again fills me with complete dread ...however sadly I know this whole sorry saga is not over yet ...... My advice to all would be to perhaps steer clear of IKEA if you can, or at least until they can find a customer focused business model to help them  navigate their way through these (in their words) ..... 'unprecedented times' !!"

Oh yes, and I nearly got run over by a dumper truck crossing the pavement outside the entrance at speed as Ikea Wembley is undergoing works.  Manifestly unsafe.8. Final addendum the aggressive man on the customer service desk never actually charged me for the exchange (despite saying he had) so after several days we have no delivery and had to go back to Ikea to sort out and, it turns out, pay.Hours and hours of wasted time trying to buy a simple TV cabinet.

My husband rang customer service and was speaking to a very ignorant English woman who would not help at all and told my husband the only thing she could do was give us a refund so I lost the plot and took the phone where I demand the stuff I ordered and paid for as I am not in the business of giving interest-free loans to foreign companies like IKEA, when I demanded they be sent out and eventually got this woman to reorder my stuff (missing a few items that were now not in stock) I had to wait ages again, and it wasn't everything I originally ordered and then after all this hassle IKEA give me a refund short €39 and when I contacted them about this I got a response that I feel implied I was lying, but I proved I wasn't, and I should not have had to do that!!

  "articleTitle": "ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING CUSTOMER SERVICE…",
  "articleText": "ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING CUSTOMER SERVICE AND TOTALLY ROGUE REFUND POLICY.I ordered a sofa, together with the TaskRabbit assembly as I am 70 years old and could never manage to do it myself.At first I was rather pleased that the sofa was to be delivered the day after I ordered it. I proceeded with booking the TaskRabbit which said they would match me with a tasker at least 24 hours before the job was to be done. I waited and nothing happened, so, I called TaskRabbit and apparently there was no TaskRabbit tasker in my area.As the sofa was going to be delivered that day (yesterday) and was already on the way, I could not cancel the order. I then had to get in touch with IKEA . The website said they were not answering emails nor operating the chat line. I clicked on the “call us” option and got... nothing. I eventually found their phone number on a Google search. I was told to refuse delivery and call back the next day (today). Which I did. I was then told that I would have to wait 14 days for a refund. I explained that I certainly would understand the delay if I had simply changed my mind either because I didn’t like the colour or I had found another sofa somewhere else. This was not the case. I had to return it because the service IKEA got me to use and book to assemble the sofa does not have anyone in my area. There is no warning about this on the IKEA website. I asked to talk to a supervisor, waited and got to talk to the most unhelpful, abrupt to the point of being almost rude person. She just kept on repeating that this 14 days was their policy and that was that. I asked how to make a formal complaint and could not believe the answer. She told me to write a review on their website! WOW that is the strangest form of formal complaint I have ever come across. I then asked to talk to someone higher or to be given the email of whoever was in charge and she just blurted out the customer service email so fast that I had to ask her to repeat it, which seemed to annoy her and she told me that they were the only people I could email. Yeah sure i would then perhaps get her workmate to answer my email in a few weeks with the same answer. In the end she just kept on asking me, robot fashion and quite abruptly, if there was anything else she could help me with.I am now stuck. 70 years old and through no fault of my own I cannot afford to order a sofa from somewhere else until I get a refund.The impression I got from this conversation is that I was just a nuisance, she could not care less and tough but I'd just have to put up with itFunny how they can process a payment in a day but it takes 14 days for a refund!Trustpilot is committed to transparency.Find out how"

The driver even called and said he would be here in 20 minutes then I get a text saying toReschedule!I sat on the phone for 30 minutes, 2 days of sittings and waiting a weekend I could have spent with my grandchildren.I spent $1200 on table and chairs, when it finally arrived, the legs and extension for table were missing. I Called 3 service representatives. I was told it will take 14 business days forIKEA to decide whether or not to give me a refund or replace the table. I had to send pictures and email and explain to people with very low intelligence. IWas told if they decide to give me a refund it would take 14 days andThey will not deliver another table although I had paid $70 for delivery of the first one, and that I would have to return damaged table top to the store. I don’t own a truck!I won’t have a dining room set for family holidays. I have a damaged table to missing the legs and extension… and no promise of a refund. NEVER AGAIN! the chairs are junk. Don’t shop here. It’s not worth the hassle and aggravation. Get a nice AMERICAN set that last. Not Swedish junk that’s full of chemicals and poor quality. I learned my lesson.Going to Gardner white tomorrow.I only hope I can return all this junk and get a full refund."

Ikea NL say they cannot see the emails despite getting 4 confirmation emails from them. I've since called 4 times. Now told to wait another 1.5 week at least and was hung up on by customer service when I asked if there was any other solution.

We have an incomplete kitchen since August because of the poor job of IKEA, and now IKEA doesn't contact us for already 20 days, even if we have been asking them to contact us through multiple channels.We should have had our kitchen counter top delivered at the of August, IKEA messed up on the measurements (yes, IKEA, not the contractor, because the contractor drawing was correct) and we notified them. They didn't hear and we had to get the contractor to come to our house again to tell us \"the measurement in the drawing are correct\" and once again IKEA made the mistake of understanding the drawing wrong and we had to tell them the order measurements wrong. We had the contractor saying to us to order it and if it happen to be wrong we would start this process again. For a company that says it is sustainable, this is the least sustainable thing you can do: order wrong measurements when we know for a fact that those are wrong and more material will be needed to do a second order. After 3 weeks, we finally fixed the miscommunication and the right order with measurements was made. This delayed the order.This was only the beginning. Then, IKEA called us telling us that the back splash measurements were too short, all was fixed quickly but as a result the order was even more delayed.But wait, there is (sadly) more: since then we had at least 2 more times the date of delivery postponed without a detailed explanation. The contractor showed at our door one day to install it and no countertop had been delivered, telling us \"IKEA didn't notify us the delivery date was postponed\".And now here we are: we got an email 20 days ago postponing our order delivery date again (keep in mind we paid in advanced) and had been asking to be contacted via email and Facebook messenger and we have had no contact from IKEA yet. Facebook messenger tell us they moved my file to the right department and that I will be contacted, and nothing happens, no call, no email, nothing.Today we got another email saying they expect us to contact the assembly partner to plan a date of instalation when they should be the ones doing it. And once again I am not getting any answer from IKEA Barendrecht, and IKEA customer service just tells me there is nothing they can do. What about delivering a service I already paid for 2 months ago?!This is unacceptable, and all this could be avoided if IKEA just called us to discuss this topic."

  "articleText": "There are some rogue thieves. I recently wanted to order 3 small products whose transport was 169 RON, while on emag, the same weight with the same surface was 39 RON. So the price of transport is 4-5 times higher than normal. Even the transport time is huge, one week (according to their estimates). If I'm lucky, I'll get a product from China sooner than that. Another stupidity was the way they answered my questions. I tried to contact them shortly after 18:00 by phone, but I could only contact them by chat. Therefore I had to make an account on their s_hitty site and after I wrote a question respectfully I waited for half an hour but without receiving an answer. As soon as I wrote to him in chat what work schedule he should have, according to their page, he started to answer me in a secretive way. The payment is another annoying thing. These returns have no refund. I would have paid with the card but it doesn't give me any security."

  "articleText": "I bought a couch from an Ikea store (in Germany, Köln-Am Butzweilerhof). When I came home, while the package was intact, the bottom of the couch had two big holes. They were so big that not only the fabric was broken but also the wood layer (you could see the mattress underneath). I tried to compile the form for the reclame for them to take the broken couch and bring me a new one. I couldn't put the receipe number, the website wanted me to put the order number (that i didn't have because I bought it in a store). So I call that call center and first they tell me to put a made up number for the order (that doesn't work, of course), then they told me that if I bought it in store, they can't pick the couch up and bring me a new one. Why? I don't know. I explained that I don't have a car and I already rent a car the day before just to go to Ikea, but they kept saying that I had to bring them the couch back in order to have a new one. So they sold me a broken couch (mind you, it wasn't in the offers, it was new) and then they told me that I'm on my own."

At this point I was so upset with customer service and IKEA policies I wanted to rip my hair out.I let her process my return,  however because I did not have the card the stuff was purchased on she said I needed to get a gift card or come BACK to get my money!

  "articleText": "We bought an Ikea kitchen including assembly of Montera in January, it is now October and the kitchen is still not installed.In the months since our purchase, IKEAs sub-contractor Montera has proven to be incapable of executing the what ought to be a simple commission. They do not arrive at appointments, they don’t know what parts they need, they do not respond on correspondence and they make short cuts that - if not detected-would have led to water damages. Just to give two of the most disheartening examples on Monteras capabilities. I myself have a past as an interior designer and in all my years working with various craftsmen and construction companies, I have never come across anything worse than Montera.When the problems are to be sorted out, both Montera and IKEA refer to each other. What is particularly distressing is that Montera has divided the company into sub sections where e.g. electrical installations are carried out by Montera-electricity - i.e. their own subcontractor. This makes it even more difficult for the customer to possibly complain and claim responsibility.To further add to examples of abandonment of responsibilities IKEA's customer service often has waiting times of one hour or more. Once you finally are put through customer service just replies that they unfortunately are not acquainted with the case and that they therefore cannot help or respond to anything. The message will all be the same: I'll take a closer look at this and I'll call you back. However, IKEA never calls backIn conclusion - do yourselves a favor and never buy installation services from IKEA and especially not their sub-contractor Montera. It seems that they both have grown so large that they do not think they have to care about their customers - show them that they are wrong!"

  "articleText": "I purchased two bedside tables costing me 160.00 in July 2021. Once I got them home there was a lot of damage on the products, including, scuffs, dent, discolouration and oil damage inside. I contacted IKEA - they could only offer me 8.00 per item as a gesture? I stated the damage was not 8.00 and it was a lot more and I travelled far to collect these. She asked me to email pictures across which I did assuming with common sense IKEA would recognise the faults.I had no response for many weeks - chasing this up. Once they picked up my email on the 24/08/21 they stated they could not see any attachments or my receipt and to email them again in the correct format.Again I emailed. Stated it was in the correct format. But again no response. They then responded again saying incorrect format! No other response.I then rang on the 14/09/21. The First Lady was unhelpful offering me a collection - advised her that the items were a surprise makeover so we had to make do and I travelled far to get this done for my Mum and that I was chasing this up from last month. Rang again, spoke to a Lady called Sarah who sounded super helpful and asked me to email her directly and magically she saw the same pictures in the format IKEA were claiming they could not see (they were in the right format) but on her return she only offered me 15% damage on each item?!I find it shocking that IKEA are happy to sell damaged goods and get away with reimbursement of 8.00 for an 80.00 item? I mean it would have been way cheaper in the bargain basement. The customer service is extremely poor and slow. IKEA are happy to take your money for items that are not as described. I have pictures to prove all of this.Receipt Number 9900186006300149310721"

  "articleText": "I had the worse experience buying whole kitchen cabinets at IKEA. They offer a good service to design your project but start buying is the real adventure. There is no one to help, the person that helped me with the design did not answer my emails anymore. I was never told I would not find everything I needed on the first order. So I ended up doing about 8 orders, going to different stores to pick up parts that were too cheap or could not be delivered for whatever reason, I never understood it. My project cost 6000 and my main reason to buy it there was to use the 24 months financing with the credit card. But because my first order was 4920,00 it did not fall on the 24-month bracket witch is 5000. The customer service of the store and of the bank is a joke. I have contacted them over 10 times and I can write lots on the absurd responses I got.  As a result of this confusion, my contractor had to rearrange his schedule to finish my renovation and work with me on a much later date than I expected. I'm not reviewing the cabinets because I did not see them yet. I have hundreds of boxes around my apartment. It took more than 2 weeks to gather all parts of the kitchen going even to Fedex store for small parts that delivery would be too expensive, and some pieces that were not essential I just gave up. Now waiting for someone to understand that puzzle and assemble them. Because I am doing with a contractor, I did not hire IKEA to do the assembling. They were more expensive anyway. But If you don't have a big job as I do, hire them.  I will never ever get close to an Ikea store yet."

In February I have reported a problem with the PAX wardrobe and I was trying to find a possible solution for myself as compensation. The whole case took 8 months. Ikea is not willing to pick up the phones neither to respond to emails. I literally had to spend hours on my phone to be finally connected with somebody from customer service. Every time when I called and asked about the status of our case I was redirected to different people who had no clue what is it about (although we already had our dossier number). Ikea ignored our emails and eventually just 2 weeks ago somebody offers us a “solution” of bringing PAX wardrobe back to Ikea (at this point I would like to mention that there was a problem with the steadiness, quality and manufacture issues of the PAX), how come could I bring back 5 meters of PAX back in the pieces - here I need to mention that:- in that case we would have to pay ourselves for transport- we wouldn’t get a compensation if the pieces are too damaged (everyone who forks for Ikea or who has PAX knows very well that it’s impossible to dismantle it without making further damage)- we would stay without a wardrobe and probably buy new one because according to Ikea the warranty does not cover up the things we reportedTo sum up, the solution that Ikea proposed was only favorable for Ikea.I never experienced more ignorant approach towards customer.I definitely won’t be a returning customer. This was my last experience with Ikea. Quality is worst and worst from year to year."

  "articleText": "Placed an order in 5/21 to be delivered across the country in July for my daughter's first apartment. I planned the delivery with my flights so I could help her put together the furniture. A day before scheduled delivery, I get a call from the delivery driver that he is at her apartment for delivery. Of course, we are thousands of miles away. I guess they just decided to delivery a day early without confirming? We were lucky that my daughter's building management accepted the delivery for us. When we finally arrived the next day across the country, we noticed that the sofa we ordered was not delivered. After many calls to Ikea they finally delivered that two weeks later, without any sort of notification (the driver actually knocked on my daughter's door at 8am Sunday morning with the sofa unannounced). She obviously had to put the sofa together herself, but it worked out.Two months later, my son moved into his first apartment, also across the country. I was hesitant to order again from Ikea based on the first experience, but decided to try since many furniture manufacturers had long wait times due to Covid. Again, we scheduled the delivery based on my flight for his move in date so I could help him assemble. We got two calls the day before scheduled delivery, and two on the scheduled date saying all was good. We waited all day in anticipation of putting together over $2000 worth of furniture. Then we got an email at 4:30 saying delivery was cancelled since we werent home! Obviously we were waiting all day. I called Ikea..number says to call back another time. Call the delivery company..on hold for 90 minutes to speak to someone, then hung up on when someone answers. Finally get through to someone on facebook messenger and they reschedule delivery for 4 days later, which I was already back home and could not help with assembly. My 23 year old son learned how to deal with (his words) \"assembly torture\", putting together everything himself while starting a new job in a new city. Two weeks in, still assembling, he realizes the coffee table was never delivered. Now trying to get in touch with someone to help. The aggravation is never ending. Never again with Ikea."

  "articleText": "I have paid for a service (matress recycling pick up) and organised it in your Utrecht location on the 29th of July.Several pick up dates were organised by Ikea's agents but each time something went wrong.The initial pickup was supposed to take place with a delivery and was not fulfilled.For 2 weeks, I had to call the customer service and delivery company at least one time per day if not more, acting as my own customer service agent.During my last call, exhausted of all this nonsense, I started complaining and losing patience. The agent was all but concilient or empathetic and starting talking louder than me. It ended up with me crying out of stress and anger as I felt \"attacked\" by the agent.I do work as a customer support agent and would never allow myself to give such a bad service and push my customers to break down.While being harsh, your agent provided no excuse nor solution and only suggested that I do everything myself which is definitely not acceptable.I did at the time request the cancellation and refind of the service I paid and never received with confirmation email.At this date I have received no communication following this discussion,I called several times again and messaged on Facebook. I am always told that I will be contacted by supervisors... Nothing.Fortunately, I found a way to get rid of the matress... Still waiting my money though!!!"

  "articleText": "I really want to like this .com, especially since I love their brick and mortar stores, but they make it SO DARN HARD. I Spent over THREE HOURS waiting for a rep. That wait was for both phone and chat service only to be told the specific item I needed to cancel was just shipped.It mattered not that it's their fault I couldn't get to their reps to inform them of the cancellation (I placed the order less then 24 hours prior so I was well within a reasonable window.) They simply wouldn't take ownership. The item was delivered and frankly the prospect of having to deal with their AWEFUL customer service is enough to make me keep it.Furthermore, for a company that boasts about being eco-friendly, that conscienceness is not reflected in their packaging. My shipments always arrive in boxes nearly three times needed. The box size to content ratio is nothing short of absurd on a cartoonish level. One would think I purchased furniture but...um nope. I purchased stuff like serving bowls, small storage boxes and jars with lids.SMDH"

Select Express later called and reported they never received the order from IKEA.Having enough of getting the run-around, I called customer service and cancelled the order, and they were nice and offered a $40 gift card for my troubles. They were friendly, too, so why was this a bad call? Because they NEVER CANCELLED THE ORDER and NEVER REFUNDED THE PURCHASE. I was receiving calls from the delivery company about scheduling delivery a few days later.So I had to call again and wait again just to cancel the order again. The rep was friendly again, and I got emails this time confirming that the order was cancelled, and the refund would be administered within 2 weeks. I'll believe it when I see it.IKEA, your choice in delivery service for the Cincinnati area is awful, and having to call back a second time to cancel an order is unacceptable."

  "articleText": "While I love the look of IKEA merchandise, I’m scrapping all plans to purchase anything else from this company! Purchased a bunch of items to attach to my Skadis pegboard (that I had to buy elsewhere for more $$ because IKEA online won’t deliver) I received a thank you email and tracking link with estimated arrival. That day came and went. Finally broke down and started calling CS and had smoke blown up my #%*^ about how FedEx probably hasn’t scanned the parcel, though on their website it states the parcel is still getting ready to ship. Finally after 6 calls, I requested a tracking number.  FedEx states they have received the purchase order but not the package itself.I call the resolutions department and FINALLY someone tells me the truth:This shipping issue has been ongoing with IKEA and management is ignoring internal requests to address the issue!Furthermore, the agent admitted that FedEx has a 3 week backlog on orders from IKEA! I find it hard to blame the carrier because I ordered pretty much everything I needed for my renovation product on the same day and the only item I HAVEN’T received is my parcel from IKEA…4 of the 11 orders have been delivered by FED-freaking-Ex, BUT none of those items were purchased from this useless store! They KNOW that any order will take weeks, not days, and they still send out bs delivery dates and useless tracking links! IKEA needs to shut down their online order branch, address their order fulfillment issues and start talking to the carriers about better delivery options. You know why shipping is so cheap in the US? Probably because they negotiated the lowest tier of delivery service with a single carrier! Why is the customer not given an option for how they want their packages shipped? USPS and UPS should be an option! I send my son a care package in KUWAIT 2 days before I made my IKEA order… he’s received his package! Really IKEA?IKEA is raking in money hand over fist but don’t give half a damned about customer service! There is a store/maze 2.5 hours away and now I regret not taking a day trip to pick up my stuff! There are rumors of them building a warehouse here in Cleveland, I hope not…but if they do, I know of one person who won’t step foot in it! Shame on you IKEA!"

On August 17th I contacted customer service to cancel the order.  It was cancelled and a refund was initiated but said it would be 10-14 days before I would receive the refund.  Well, never got the refund.  It's now September 17th and I'm on the phone with customer service and being told my case ID doesn't exist!

They are doing their best but it's not their fault that their company is so spectacularly disorganized. Ikea: I don't care what you do or how you reorganize your company. Take some pity on your employees and give them an infrastructure they can work with which doesn't leave them dangling in the cracks with the harried customers they're trying to help.Oh and also... I am unlikely to shop at Ikea EVER again. You have lost a customer for life, and I am going to be telling everyone I know to avoid dealing with your customer service at all costs."

Well I sincerely hope that all the other poor people waiting for delivery finally concede to not having their order fulfilled and cancel in their  droves, serves you right IKEA.And just see how many come back. I certainly will not.Even if Management became concerned the shambles of a delivery system is such that it's a miracle it ever works anyway."

After I called customer service support, they provided me with a reference 38456607.Due to moving to a new house, I purchased some items online 26th August and they informed me the estimated ship date should be 11th September.  Because I was living by myself and going back to the office, I thought it would be easier to order online. The truth is I suffered without anything for almost two weeks. I contacted your team and they said some of the items were out of stock.I wonder why you didn't contact me regarding this stuitation. After that he told me the nearest delivery date is 10th Oct and probably more and more items will be out of stock. it is stupid. If you can't do well on stock control, why do you need to open an online shop for customers?I decided to cancel the entire order and wait for my full refund. but they said the policy is that I need to wait around 14 days. I feel angry that I shopped at IKEA, you held my fund for one month and it was a waste of my time.Please issue my refund asap and I am not happy to wait until 14 days."

The website don't work at all, the customer service don't help at all and take a whole life to reply and in the end come up with some lame excuse. I hope another big company come around here and start a competition, that's the only way for these people wake up. Hey Leroy Merlin, it's time to come!

Ikea sells cheap stuff, you get what you pay for, and then their customer service is horrendous and disrespectful. To make someone hold for 45 minutes just to talk to someone is a freakin Crime.

The customer support was the worst I have ever known. I have had staff put me on hold and then end the call with no returning of my calls. On a whole they offered me a £150 voucher for the hassle caused - as you can imagine I declined this. If you are ever thinking of buying a kitchen from IKEA, please do yourself a favour and AVOID. The upset and stress is not worth it. Terrible company and do not look after their customers or give you any compensation for their mistakes."

When I go to pick it up at IKEA Barendrecht at the appointed time and I am provided with \"all\" the elements, I noticed myself that the order was not complete as it was missing the 3 HUGAD (good to mention that as you can imagine these are a key element of this combination). The staff at the pick up point had to check multiple times to confirm me of this issue (because apparently it was out of stock in Barendrecht) and PROMISED me (expected from a proper service) that the missing pieces will be delivered to me free of cost at my place. Later that same day, I receive a cancellation email of these three missing pieces, without even asking me about it. Now you please tell me how am I going to mount the curtain combination without those pieces. To add to this terrible user experience, that same day I check online and those pieces were indeed available at IKEA in Barendrecht and I had to travel yet another time to pick those myself, leading to unnecessary hassle, effort and time.In all honesty I find this whole experience ridiculous and outrageous and I find it unacceptable how I have been treated, the service provided and how this issue has been handled."

So I called IKEA to get this resolved. I made 8 calls and they said someone would call me back.  Never got a call back.  I email them 5 times and never received a reply.  Thank goodness I had an American friend that spoke Greek that talked to the delivery company.  My stuff had been in the area for 14 days???? I finally got my stuff, I will never buy from Ikea again.

  "articleText": "If i could put 0 stars I would. I’ve ordered from Ikea a total of 3 times now. The first time i ordered from Ikea, i ordered the Full Size Malm Bed Frame with a couple of other things. Well, when the delivery day came, I was told by the delivery men that “it seems we forgot two packages at the warehouse, we’ll be back with it in a few hours. They never came back. The same day i called Ikea customer service & explain to them that i was missing the third package for my bed frame as well as a shelf i ordered. She was very polite, & explained to me that the shelf was out of stock so i’d be refunded for it and that there “wasn’t a 3rd package for the bed frame.” Well a few days later when i go to assemble it I’m missing the middle support beam & the slated bed bases. So the following morning i call Ikea and inform them of this. They gave me a $50 gift card & told me they’d have it to me as soon as possible. Well apparently there’s no rush shipping so it still took nearly 4 weeks; 4 weeks sleeping on the floor.The second time i ordered from Ikea there were no issues, the missing items from my first order came at the same time my second order did.The 3rd and final time i ordered from them was just recently. I ordered the Hovet Mirror, two shelves, & a chair. A few weeks prior from the delivery date i was sent an email that the chair was out of stock and that i’d be refunded for it. The delivery date was set for September 1st. I live in Louisiana, a massive hurricane just hit us so i expected there to be a delay in my items being delivered which i was completely fine with. I got an email September 3rd saying that i’d be refunded my entire purchase because all of the items i ordered were “out of stock.” I was livid. As soon as i read the email i called Ikea and explained to them why i was frustrated since i waited 3 weeks for my items to be delivered & two days after they were supposed to be delivered i got an email saying i’d be refunded. The man i spoke to was very nice & explained why he didn’t understand that i received that email considering everything was in stock. He told me that i could replace my order using a link he sent to my email. They still had my money so i didn’t understand why they couldn’t use the money they already took from my account to put forth on this new order that wouldn’t come till the end of September.I didn’t place the order because i’m convinced Ikea is a scam. I wasn’t given a valid reason as to why my order was cancelled at the very last second, nor was i ever apologized to. When you see others ordering from this company with no issues you wonder “why me?”"

  "articleText": "After 3 weeks of waiting for the estimated delivery date, which is already a huge timeframe compared to almost every other store (even more so when paying such a huge delivery fee), and having no update, it was clear that our order wasn't going to arrive.I got in touch with Ikea only to find they don't have two of the items in stock. They're only minor items compared to the other stuff, so we're happy to remove and refund them. What we're not happy with is waiting 3 weeks for the delivery date, with absolutely no word from Ikea, to find that this could have been sorted much sooner if they had actually bothered to inform us of the stock issues. I dread to think how much longer we'd have been left waiting if I hadn't gotten in touch with them.At my request, they removed the two out of stock items and rescheduled the delivery, split over 3 different days. What they neglected to mention was that they had removed 2 additional items from the order.Quite frankly terrible service. I certainly won't be ordering from them again."

  "articleText": "I was expecting a truck delivery from ikea today. The window being 7am to 7pm and as nothing had arrived nor did I receive any email, text or notification, I called to enquire where the delivery was. Only to be told that it got missed in pick up and therefore isn't on its way to me today. I was understanding and asked if it can be prioritised to be delivered tomorrow. I was told that the drivers only come out to the area once a week and therefore I have to wait another week for my order. For starters, the error was made, fair enough but nothing has been done to assure the customer that they are doing what they can to try and rectify the problem, instead I am being told I need to wait. Secondly, a whole week away? Surely with the amount charged for delivery fees, ikea can organise for a special delivery seeing as though the error was on their end. To make matters worse when asking if there is a way I can be notified on the delivery next week, I was told there is no way for me to be notified unless I call (and the wait time to speak to someone isn't a short one) and enquire on the day. The lack of communication and service is pathetic. I am a long time ikea shopper and am waiting on two orders. I assure you, these will be the last orders I will ever place for myself, my family and my friends."

  "articleTitle": "I don’t even know where to start but…",
  "articleText": "I don’t even know where to start but this singlehandedly had to be the worst and most frustrating customer experience I have encountered during the pandemic.I wanted to get a shelf for my basement and a monitor stand for my desktop. Since we are still in a pandemic, I was hoping to be able to just pick online and have it delivered but already encountered the first issue there:1.\tOnline shopping unfriendly inventory management: Depending on what you are trying to order you may be eligible for online delivery or not. In my case the items I picked were only available for physical pickup at a store further away then 2 other Ikea stores. For those not wanting to go into the store physically (still in a pandemic) this led to the next problem:2.\tFee for curbside or locker pickup: I understand having to pay for delivery to my home (which again wasn’t even an option) but having to pay for driving down to a store further away seems weird in this day and age. I decided to opt for the “Locker pickup” option which led to again another problem:3.\tPoor to no instructions for locker pickup: Once the order was ready for pickup I received a code to be used at the locker but no further instructions. No instructions can be found on the website either as to where to find those ominous lockers. No problem I though, I will figure it out once there. Guess what, next problem:4.\tNo instructions or signage for locker pickup on site: Arriving at the Vaughn location in Toronto there is signage to follow to the regular entrance and then there is signage to lead you to “click and collect” at the lower level of the parkade which I now know is the equivalent to curbside pickup (Keep in mind that Ikea locations and their associated parking lots are typically rather large layouts with multilevel parking). The email confirmation for the locker pickup confusingly uses the terminology “click and collect” as well so surely this would be the right way to go. After arriving at the spot and sending a text with my order number I am told after waiting for 15 minutes that I have to pickup my order upstairs at the lockers. Driving back out the parkade and upstairs in front of the store, lockers are nowhere to be seen. I get out of the car ask an employee. They tell me to go inside (Great, still pandemic). I go inside, can’t find anything, ask another employee who tells me they are outside on the other end of the building at the exit. Go figure. Finally, having located the lockers (again no signage there whatsoever even after I knew where to find them) I picked up my order and drove home, just to discover, you guessed it another problem:5.\tMisleading product description: Turns out that what I thought where floating shelves are just boards for a shelf, requiring additional brackets to be bough. Upon closer inspection that piece of information is buried in the hidden fine print of the product description. Armed with this knowledge I now am interested in buying a proper floating shelf and returning the two useless boards that are called a shelf. At this point I am very curious about what the next problem may be:6.\tDifficult return process: Unlike with other online shopping experience return information for a particular order are hard to find. They are not in the order confirmation email nor in the order summary of the website. You find them separately on the website and then manually add in your specific order information. At this point it would be boring if there weren’t further problems:7.\tReturns in person only: Did I mention that we are in a pandemic? Having filled out my online return form it tells me that now I am good to return it in person at any physical store. Excellent, tried to do that today, drove to a closer store this time (Still 40 minutes drive) only to discover the final problem:8.\tReturns require appointments or very long wait times: If you didn’t have an appointment for a return the wait time, I am told by an employee is 2 hours. How do you get an appointment you ask? Easy just another form, somewhere on the website, the employee couldn’t really tell me where. 2 forms not easily found to accomplish 1 simple thing.At this point I am beyond frustrated. What I bought isn’t even worth the gas and depreciation of driving to Ikea twice, nor are 2 hours of my live worth it. I secretly hope that somebody in HQ will have a bad tasting meatball for lunch...."

We have waited in for 6 failed attempts for a 50cm carcass wardrobe which apparently keeps getting stuck in their system. No one in customer service helps to solve the problem and when you escalate it as a complaint they can't transfer you as they have to email someone. We even spoke to the warehouse yesterday and they said it was on the picking list for today....once again no call or message just another non-delivery for the sixth time. We honestly don't know how to stop this cycle of frustration and nonsense and after 4 weeks still have 3/4 of a wardrobe sitting upstairs. If you are reading this and considering buying something which requires delivery I honestly wouldn't....and never will again."

I was told I would receive a replacement part within 5-7 business days. On business day 10 I called again and after 48 minutes on the phone was told my case was cancelled and no part was being sent because I did not have my original receipt. This was AFTER being told the part was ordered and on the way to me. I asked to speak with a supervisor and the CSR kept telling me they would tell me the same thing. When I insisted they put me on hold another 20+ minutes telling me no supervisor was currently available and then strangely disconnected after over an hour on the phone. My first phone call was 1 hour and 32 minutes long. Their customer service is a joke. They take no ownership and give no solutions for replacement pieces for their broken parts. I will no longer be purchasing from them and advise you to only buy items you know will never need replacement...unlike the particle board drawer set that I paid way too much for."

  "articleText": "Yesterday I went to Ikea Montreal since I needed couple of screws to be able to assembly my son’s changing table.  There was a line of about 40 people I had to pass before I was able to tell some one to provide me with 4 screws missing.  That is just ridiculous! We are all dealing with the pandemia and I havent seen a store like that.  They put everyone in a line before they are classified according to their needs.  Very bad management!. Yesterday I felt like I rather buy my stuff somewhere else, so scary to need to reach customer service there.  What was amazingly easy was to go inside and buy something.  All normal!  The message I got between lines was:  We sell you what you need to buy, just dont come back to bother us or we will give you an special treatment :(. I think Customer service management should do much better than that.  What a shame, i used to like Ikea’s products.Before they used to have screws in the liquidation section.  Now even that.  They moved everything to their amazing customer service.  I mean You change to improve, not to make the things even worse for people right?"

I got myself so worked up reading review after review of horrible experiences; people claiming that they never received their item, it never even went out for delivery, the wrong product came, etc. I was actually debating on cancelling and contacting customer service before I even gave them a chance, and to just take my money elsewhere and invest in another company, even if the prices could be a bit more expensive.I got a call two days prior to my delivery date stating that my mattress was shipped and being brought to a closer facility, and was told that it was going to be delivered on Sep. 1st. The next day, the day before my delivery, I got the same call, but this time it notified me of a time frame, which was that the mattress would be delivered anywhere from 11am-3pm. Today, I got the call from a delivery driver at about noon stating that they were roughly five minutes away. Sure enough, they were! Smooth, perfect delivery. They placed the mattress in my garage where I told them and that was that. And my mattress is comfortable (although it still needs time to fluff up all the way)!"

When I checked my order tracking online, it said \"Waiting to be picked\". When I checked what this meant, I saw that it meant the items needed to be picked up from a warehouse. At that moment I realized that there was an issue so I called them to learn that the delivery will not happen today and the next slot they can book for me is 28 days later, which is not only very late but also coincided with travel for me. So in the end I had to cancel the order and ask for a refund. Very disappointed with IKEA regarding this. They could at least notify me that there is a delay with my shipment which they did not.

I placed the order and had a hard time because it would not let me input the full address so I had to call and do it over the phone (more time consuming).  Finally got the order placed.I days later get a text that they tried to deliver my order to the warehouse but couldn't please call.  I called and was told it wasn't open when they tried to deliver it.  Note that I told the rep that this was a warehouse it had to deliver during business hours and repeated this several times while on the phone.  They tried to deliver at 9PM  So went through everything again and the IKEA rep put me on hold to reach out to company they contracted to get this set up to deliver following day.  I was on hold forever and got disconnected.  Rep called me and left a message that it could deliver the next day to call her back.  I call her back and no one can get me connected with Jackie.  I said get a message to her that delivery next day was good and thank her.  Fast forward to today I realize I never got confirmation of delivery.  Call IKEA and it was never delivered and never attempted.  So did not make it in time for our show.  Yet no one bothered to call me at all or reach out.I asked for an explnation and the have no notes nothing from Jackie in the system she did not put anything in there from the day we spoke.  WHAT????? So ask them to do the \"RIGHT\" thing and I would now like for it to be shipped to my warehouse where I store our booth properties.  NOPE they told me I had to cancel the order and reorder.  I asked what they were going to do to help me since it was IKEA in the wrong....they literally told me NOTHING.  We can cancel the order.This company is not customer focused and really does not care about building a good relationship with its customers.Will NEVER do business with them and would caution you to shop and work with a company that respects its customers"

Our problem: IKEA was supposed to deliver our customized kitchen worktop this August (as part of an IKEA kitchen we had already had installed) but we still haven't received it! The worktop weighs 160 KGs and is 3 meters long. IKEA should have realized that this worktop could not be delivered to 3rd floor apartment. It was too heavy and too long. The delivery guys tried twice, second time with a lift but gave up. It was unrealistic from the start. Now IKEA wants us to organize a crane and pay for it. So we have to coordinate it and then contact IKEA about when we have it ready. So IKEA push all responsibility on customer when things go wrong. They say, they can deliver, but in reality you are on your own. No help, no empathy, no service. That is IKEA!"

We've been trying to deal with Ikea's customer service for weeks and have no luck at all. We spent hours on the phone and days on their chat trying to get someone to replace our order or issue a refund. They said in 2 weeks they will contact us again for our... case number!! The average company auto-generates case numbers. How on earth does it take this long?It's been much longer than 2 weeks and we've received no replacement items, no contact from Ikea, and of course no refund.We tried our luck at the store again and still, nothingggg is in stock. It's honestly unbelievable. And I am really afraid to drop a bunch of money via their website again because I don't trust them.

We onyl wanted a sandwich and to be able to get on with our shopping we had to queue for 30 min with everyone else just to get a sandwich. The uptake of masks by IKEA employees was about 1/3 for the staff we saw around the store how surely they should be leading by example to the customers. The hand sanitiser by the toilets was empty which is next to some screens with an instruction to sanitise your hands before using them. Just an awful experience all round we will not be returning to IKEA any time soon if at all. If I could give no stars I would!"

Im now looking at at least half a year with  no closet system.  Ikea needs to update how they complete orders and take everything off their website that they do not have!"

Designer will go off on there own and design the kitchen meaning there is little communication about what you need and want, in the end a cupboard was missed, and instead of it being replaced quickly another appointment needed to be scheduled.  This doesn't feel like a kitchen design service anymore, I wouldn't recommend or use them again."

  "articleText": "This review is for IKEA at College Park, Maryland.We made 3 orders, got 2 delivered but not the 3rd one which was supposed to be delivered on last week 8/15/2021 (today is 8/23/2021). Nobody gave us any update about it before I called and waited 30 min and talked to 3 customer service reps. I was told:* Some items are out of stock. Ikea didn't know when would be in stock.* i'd have to call ikea everyday to check & request to put items aside for the order if an item is available. Ikea will not do it. Again, everytime i made a call, had to wait at least 30min before able to talk to a rep, and then transferred 2 more times (10 minutes waiting the between).I asked if I can return all items in previous orders because some components are in the 3rd order, and without the 3rd order those items are incomplete to use. I was told I can return, but ikea won't come to pick up due to pandemic and I'd have to transport items to the store by myself. I paid for delivery because I don't have a truck, so how can I carry the items back? They don't care.This whole thing is so weird and doesn't make sense to me at all. Why wouldn't the store check the order and put the items aside whenever available in the store to make it ready for delivery? How can ikea ask customers to check and call them to notify to make the order complete? i paid $40 for them to get the items from the isles; so they won't do it until i call and tell them to do so?"

So, after unpacking the furnitures, I was expecting each piece to be lettered or numbered but none was! Secondly , packaging is too hard to open and I also got my hands bruised several times just trying to take out these furnitures from the boxes. Another problem I had is one of the furnitures never came with the instruction paper. IKEA, how do you expect me to build a furniture without its instructions?! The furnitures are cute and nice though. That I like! But with lack of proper instructions and labeling, I almost spoiled the furnitures today. And I noticed on one of the instruction paper that came with its furniture shows that it’d be preferable to call IKEA for assistance over the phone, that’s great but I doubt it’d change anything.With this awful experience I’ve had shopping from IKEA for the first time, I don’t think it’s worth going back there."

But when I click on the FedEx tracking number FedEx says that the number has been generated but that the order has not been received by FedEx yet. Then the wait begins. Months later I get an email saying my order has been delivered, but it hasn't. When I check with FedEx they say they never received the order from IKEA and confirm that no delivery was made. When I check with IKEA, (which is a very time-consuming process involving talking to multiple departments) I am told that indeed nothing has shipped and they do not know what is going on so they cancel the order and refund my money. Great, I have my money back but I'd really rather have gotten what I ordered or been told they can't process my order so I could go buy it someplace else without waiting months, tying up my money and wasting a lot of my time :(  PS I have all this documented if anybody from IKEA is interested and would like to review it."

I am missing THE ACTUAL SEAT OF THE CHAIR. THE USABLE PART OF THE CHAIR. I am furious. I call customer service.

I will have to wait for another email to reschedule delivery. There is nothing she can do. She tells me the items will be back in stock on Wednesday (4 days after my requested, $200 delivery date). I call Tuesday to follow up. Somehow, this person knows even less than the previous person. Again, I am told there is nothing she can do. She doesn't know when the items are coming back in stock. All I have to do is wait and hope that I get an email to reschedule delivery. I check the website. The items are in stock in my nearest store (140 miles away, I have no car, hence why I paid for delivery). She says \"oh, that's the stock for our store. Our online warehouse is different.\" Makes sense? Wednesday comes. I call again. This time, a more competent person answers the phone. She asks if I have a case number and if I made sure to call within the 48 reporting period for missing delivery items. I have called customer service 3 times now and was never told about either of these things. This woman creates a case number for me. She again cannot tell me when the items will be back in stock or when I can expect to have them. She says it's written somewhere on the website (I have yet to find it) that the delivery dates aren't guaranteed. Even though, you pay an obscene amount for delivery, they cannot even ensure you will have all your items on the day you choose. She says she tagged my case with \"high priority\" and someone will call within 24 hours. All three times, I asked for a refund considering I did not get what I paid for. I was told the only compensation they could provide would be store credit. As if after all this, I would shop there again. Today, no one called within the 24 hour period. I call again. I am told that yesterday's customer service agent refunded me for the two missing items. I said that I never asked to be refunded. Once I was told I could not be, I said never mind. I want/need the items. The lady says they are out of stock and they will be until September 11th although she sounds incredibly uncertain of this. There is nothing she can do, so I hang up. I was forced to buy the bed slats from Amazon for $80. That is $50 more than on Ikea's site. I called customer service 5 times, and no one was willing or able to remedy my situation or provide customer service. I am a student who just moved to a new state. I have been sleeping on the floor for a week and will probably do so for another week. Good customer service would have been having someone deliver my items from my closest store. Good customer service would have been informing me that the items were on back order, that I might not receive what I ordered, or informing me that I am being refunded and my order is being canceled. Good customer service would have been NOT SELLING THE ITEMS IF THEY DO NOT EXIST. IF SUPPLY CANNOT MEET DEMAND, DO NOT TRICK YOUR CUSTOMERS INTO THINKING THEY WILL HAVE YOUR ITEMS ON A CERTAIN DAY. To top it all off, I am unable to leave a review on Ikea's website as there is no option to do so. When contacting their agents via live chat, the agent left the chat after I said I was unable to leave a review. I am absolutely appalled that Ikea, a global brand, would treat their customers so poorly, would hire such clueless customer service reps, and would do absolutely nothing to fix this problem. I will never shop there again, and I will ensure no one I know does either."

  "articleText": "I’ve just used truspilot to complain about a service from LV car insurance.  It reminded me of how well I was treated a couple of months ago by IKEA.  I’d come home with a damaged item, two instead of one of another item and charged twice for an item I’d only bought one of.  I wrote to them (with photos and of receipts).  I got back a very well expressed apology and money back.  It was extremely impressive as so often IKEA is complained about for a variety of issues.  I like the store very much but have had reservations on occasions - usually because I’m so tired by the time I’ve got round it - but I have to say that in this instance their customer service was second to none. So, well  done the complaints department at IKEA!  LV car  insurance could learn a lot from you!"

  "articleTitle": "Delivery service is bad, customer service is worse",
  "articleText": "I ordered a Friheten sectional with the room-of-choice-delivery because I do not have a car where I live.  The delivery service delivered the boxes quickly and efficiently, in and out in under a couple minutes.  After they left, I realized a box was damaged, the particle board on the inside was clearly busted without having to open the box.  I am quite confident they were aware of the damage because of how the boxes were positioned (They also had to navigate an elevator and hallway, so plenty of opportunities to see the damage).I contacted customer service, and after being on hold for 30 minutes, I was told the item was not in stock for delivery and could not be replaced.  There was no way to pre-order it, no way for them to call me back, etc.  My only options were to call back every day (and they have long hold times) to try to get a replacement or they could offer me a refund.  I went the refund route, and they said they would be in contact regarding a pickup.  It should have been a red flag that they couldn't schedule that on the initial call.Days go by, still no response from them, so I call again, and they are going to escalate the call. Due to the price, they cannot offer a refund until they have received the item back.  Keep in mind I have large sectional size boxes that are taking up apartment space.A week goes by, still no response.  I notice that the product is back in stock, so I call again to see what my options are for a replacement instead.  I am told I will need to purchase this out of pocket because they have to have the original box back.  They cannot pick up the box when they deliver the new one either.  I am also told that they are unable to do pickups at this time, but if I hold on to it for \"a few months\", they should be able to pick it up and refund me at that time.Ultimately I borrowed a car after 5 weeks, and spent the several hours returning the box.  Because the Ikea was in a different state, I also got back less sales tax on the refund.  They would not refund the delivery fee as promised on the phone calls because there were a couple of other small items on the initial order.  On top of that the replacement was still a little damaged, but not worth the hassle (which I believe is their goal in customer service).A few takeaways for me:1 - I was promised a call back after every call made, but have not received a single one.2 - Every Ikea customer service reps had a different interpretation of the situation.  For a company this well thought out and efficient, I have to assume that it is their goal to be as unhelpful as possible so that people give up on getting their refunds.3 - The reviews on their site are curated.  I usually receive an email to leave a review after a purchase, but when I had a problematic order, that email was conveniently not sent out.  I am seeing other recent reviews for this item though.  Maybe it is a coincidence, but I no longer trust them as a company.4 - Between calls, having to borrow a vehicle and return it on my own (while also still being out the cost of shipping and some sales tax) I have spent at least 8 hours dealing with them, still have a slightly damaged sectional, and an intense anger towards them as a company."

  "articleText": "The reason IKEA Canada is getting one star is that a) I can't rank them lower and b) their freezing bags are durable and close well. Too bad their furniture doesn't meet the expectations any longer (fair price for fair quality).I bought two PAX wardrobes with sliding doors. Not only did IKEA not have all of the items ready for delivery at the time of order (bought online and paid for delivery in May 2021), but for the missing pieces, I had to place a separate order and go to the other side of the town to pick them up (why their ERP system doesn't create a back-order immediately and IKEA takes responsibility for delivery is beyond my ability to comprehend).Had I known that the side panels would come already scratched (they don't even recommend the touch up-paint for a given market), that the screws would be missing (who's gonna line-up in a hardly moving line-up for 4 screws?!) and above all, that some of the hardware would come loosely assembled (and of course, something like that we didn't notice until it was too late), I would have never bought these. I certainly overpaid for both the quality and experience.On the same token, I'm glad I had this experience now, prior to buying 2 sets of kitchen cabinets and other bedroom & office furniture. I have a feeling (corporate) Ikea doesn't care any longer about repeat business - I am surely taking mine elsewhere."

  "articleText": "I wish I could explain this nightmare without putting readers to sleep.IKEA must have some form of new policy that says that if a customer has an complaint they must ignore, lie, generally caused this customer as much stress and anxiety as humanly possible.I purchased a new sofa on the 06/07/2021, unfortunately the seating cushions appeared to small for the covers, there was excessive amounts of material.so I immediately rang IKEA for help.I was advised that someone would have to call and look at the issue and I would receive an email on the Friday confirming the appointment on the following Monday.Neither of these things happen.I again rang IKEA but was advised they had No record of this, which shocked me.I was then advised that they could replace the settee but unfortunately there were no stock in any of my local stores so I would have to wait for a replenishment.Sometime passed so again I rang and made a logical suggestion to a customer service representative.I suggested seeing that it’s only the seating cover and pads that are affected could they not just order replacement parts, the lady agreed and ordered a free set of new covers and two new seating pads apparently from your lakeside store, I thought great sorted so I thought.sometime later Royal Mail turned with ONE seating pad with the same reference number I was given by customer service it was also 18 centimeters smaller than my exiting sofa cushion, obviously from a completely different sofa.I was furious and rang IKEA again, the stupidity didn’t end there on that particular day, they also advised that the order for the free replacement covers had been canceled because it hadn’t been paid for.The person who I spoke to called Chris assured me that the replacement covers were still on order and the two seating pads still hadn’t been picked from the lakeside store.He had no idea what or why had been delivered to me that day.He said this was due to happen on the 02/08/2021.Today the 05/02/2021 I still haven’t received either.What I have received is an email on Response on Resolver informing me that the sofa and covers are discontinued I was absolutely incensed with anger at IKEA incompetence and lies.I have replied to the email and received a response from an idiot saying he couldn’t trace any previous case numbers or emails so I downloaded the entire case and forwarded that via Resolver.Your Company are not fit for purpose and shouldn’t be allowed to trade. I’ve also requested two manager call backs, both have never materialized one of the managers was called JAG which was Chris’s manager the customer care representative who advised the two item were still on order."

I bought a bed for my teenage son and just under 2 years, the slats kept on fallen off the bed. I was sent an expert to check if the bed was faulty and as I could not show the whole bed (my son has a diagnosis of autism and will let no one in his room) so I showed him the slats which most of them were not holding together due to the cheap fabric that are between them. The expert confirmed that he will get me some new slats and I would have settled for this, as I could not show the whole bed. IKEA were not understanding of the fact that my son has a disability and I wasn’t able to show the whole bed.They called me about 2 weeks ago, on a Sunday 25/07/2021 and never bothered to call me back even though today is the 05/08/2021. Therefore, I called them and even though they advertised 10 min wait, I waited 20 min. Then, I spoke to the customer service agent who put me on hold for another 10 min. She failed to ask me if I preferred a call back rather than waiting yet again. After this, she told me that the bed is not faulty, even though the slats won’t hold on the frame. The bed has a 25 years guarantee and it did not last 2 years. Very poor customer service and product quality. There is no care towards their customers, they do not value them I will never buy from this company again."

  "articleTitle": "IKEA Delivery Not Turning Up Week After Week.",
  "articleText": "IKEA charged me £40 for delivery telling me they were splitting my order into 2 delivery dates: 2 and 3 weeks after ordering (the first containing smaller items to be delivered by parcel, second: large items by van).I waited in all day for the parcel delivery - nothing came. I received an email at 8:05pm telling me something went wrong and that it might be that an item isn't in stock. Why couldn't they have told me that the day before or even during the day?!They said my new delivery date would now be in another 2 weeks time.The website showed that the van delivery was still coming a week later alongside this new date for the parcel a week after that.A week later, I again waited in, the van delivery didn't arrive and no email received this time. I can only assume that everything will be delivered on the new delivery date for the parcel (which is over 4 weeks from the date I made the order).I cannot get through to IKEA to check. They have closed email, chat, don't answer the phone and don't answer DMs on Messenger.This is the absolute worst company I've ever bought from.Currently going against all trading standards.So far, I have moved into my new home and paid over £1294 for furniture and small things like a cafetiere and a baking tray and am wondering when I'm going to see it!"

We spent £260 on both and then realised the boxes were far too big to fit into my car. Our only option was to go to the home delivery desk and get them delivered to our home. IKEA claim to be able to send the products to your home the very same day. We were told this was not possible as they couldn’t even contact the people who deliver the products. They told us they could deliver the next day between 12pm-6pm. We paid £29 and then received a message later in that evening saying the delivery would actually be between 12pm-4pm. On the day we received no correspondence from the delivery company or IKEA and the products were not delivered between that time, despite calling them multiple times and they told us it would be delivered in that time. They then told us it would be delivered before 6pm. It did not show. We must have called 14 times that day to the customer service IKEA and we’re told blatant lies each time. We were told it would then 100% be delivered before 7pm and that the delivery man was actually on his way to ours. Still no show. We were eventually told it would not be arriving that day and we would receive a phone call the next day between 8am-10am. No call. After ringing twice again they then told us they had no idea where our products were and had no idea if or when they would be delivered. We were then that frustrated we wanted a full refund for the products and the delivery and were told we would have to drive all the way back to the Warrington store to get a refund. When we arrived at the Warrington store, to our amazement. Our wardrobe and chest of drawer boxes were on the trollies exactly where we left them in the store. They hadn’t even been moved from where we set them on the day of purchase. The refund assistant on till had once again, no idea what was going on noe did the manager, Chris. The assistant or Chris didn’t even greet us or apologise for the inconvenience this had caused us. Absolutely shocked by the service and will never ever be shopping with IKEA again, I will also be telling everyone I know of the shocking service they provide. Terrible company, do not waste your time."

The two stiffening rods (is that the correct word?!) installed in a V shape under the mattress. They were also hard to install as the rod where one must screw the screw did not have a proper screw thread. Anyway eventually it worked. The squeaking can be helped with a bit of insulating tape. Installation would be easier using screws with a counterpart.Another thing is now when I tried to order I got the \"we can't deliver to your postal code\" message _after_ I clicked the order button, which is strange. I hope IKEA can improve it. (\"Im Moment können wir eine Lieferung an diese Postleitzahl nicht ermöglichen.\")"

  "articleText": "I ordered a lovely corner sofa bed on the 16/7/21 and the delivery slot I chose was the 20/7/21 which for IKEA I thought was super quick. All was confirmed via email and everything was fine, was told 7am - 7pm but I’d get a 4h time slot a day or so before and another text on the day so I can track it. Fast forward to today (day of delivery) I’ve had no emails, no texts, no contact. I just got off the phone with IKEA customer service who said that my delivery date had been changed to 24/7/21 as they didn’t have all the parts. I would have been totally ok with this and these things happen, however when I’d had no contact to say this and I had rearranged all my week so I could be in all day today for the delivery I think it’s outrageous. All I wanted was a text or email to say the date needed to be changed and there would be no issues. But now I have to cancel plans and re arrange my week once again. To make matters worse it’s my anniversary weekend and now we can’t do anything on the 24th as we’ve got to be in all day 🙄"

  "articleText": "Ordered a kitchen from Ikea.No delivery dockets with orders so 100 boxes approx arrived, no way of knowing if anything missing. all deliveries need a delivery docket for this purpose.We start building the kitchen, no counter top. 4 weeks of contacting IKEA and noone can find the item. No staff can let me talk to a manager. No person can return my call. 4 weeks after missing item was notified to Ikea and no move forward.Last night I receive a curt mail stating they can't find it and now have reordered.Was due June 19th, now due 16th August.When you build a kitchen, you take out the old. So there is no kitchen and no water, for 2 months.Not once did Ikea apologise.Had they have responded internally i wouldn't have lost 4 weeks before they reordered.So my advice is: Can you afford to live with half a kitchen for 2 months? If not, you might want consider shopping elsewhere.Ikea have good products but if it goes wrong, you will face a blank wall, and literally no way to get them to respond.Awful customer experience."

At the store, I saw the right item which is MORABO Loveseat, Gunnared dark gray/woodsize 166 cm(65 3/8\"). A worker proposed to help me by checking the availability of the item. After a quick look on the computer, he told me the item is available on store to pick up but delivery will be available July 13. I decided to purchase it and accept delivery July 13. Instead of giving me the information for the love seat, he gave sofa ( 206cm= 81 1/8\") which much bigger than the love seat even bigger than the sofa I thrown away to buy the love seat. I just call customer service to let them know that the item the send me is not the love seat but sofa. The lady says the only thing to is to bring the item back to the store because they don't do pick up. I am frustrated because my husband is disable he is on a wheelchair. We went to the store to buy the right item and the ikea agent gave us the wrong info.  Now, we cannot use the sofa since it is too big for our apartment and we don't have anyway to bring back to the store."

  "articleText": "I ordered on June 11, 2021, a full kitchen furniture and full home appliances from Ikea (Romania), but I was delivered a kitchen without 5 doors and I wasn't delivered with handles for any doors or drawers. I wasn't told that the doors will arrive late in stock, it was only after I called Customer Services to ask for the doors that I found out they will arrive on September or maybe never. I was told that the doors will come in 2 months. I sent several emails asking for a solution, but Ikea came to install the incomplete kitchen and afterwards offered to change all doors with doors from an inferior product (as price and design), announcing me that the 5 missing doors will be delivered in 3 months instead of 2 months. I then asked for a discount, as all my things have been and are currently on the floor and I am not able to use the kitchen for more than 50%, and Ikea refused to grant me a discount and propose the installation of provisory doors at my cost. I proposed Ikea to pay for the provisory solution and refused to do so, claiming system issues :). I then asked for the handles to be delivered and I have now to wait one more week for their installation. I regret buying the kitchen from this company, I thought they are professional and customer oriented, but their approach is abusive and neglectful and rigid. Moreover, the advertising they make about their products and services is misleading, as the quality of their services is low."

I waited at home all day but nobody came and also nobody called me to let me know about what was going on. I called IKEA customer service today.

I was supposed to get this service yesterday. Why should I wait more as it is not my problem that this service does not take place.I can not keep rebooking this service again and again. You have put me in a really difficult situation. I am not able to return it by myself. Please take this item from my place by 17th July.Collection Ref Number: 37701553"

  "articleText": "Horrendous experience with kitchen. We bought a kitchen through Ikea, spending around 40.000 DKK. The oven hasn't worked properly since day 1, and we have now had 3 engineers to come out and fix the problem. Each time they have been there for 5 minutes and failed to do anything other than turn the oven on, stick there hand in it, and say 'well it feels warm'.So, 4 months later we still have an oven that burns half the food while the other half remains raw. Ikea continue to tell us that it's not their responsibility to fix this issue, despite it clearly being stated in EU law that it is clearly their responsibility."

  "articleTitle": "Schlechter Kundenservice",
  "articleText": "We used Ikea kitchen planning serviceGeneral view1) It took them 2 weeks to respond to our online request2) the kitchen planner sometimes forgot what was agreed in our previous discussion. Some were even written in the email but he ignored it.3) there’s no way to contact the kitchen planner when the order went wrong. We were only allowed to call customer services. However, the customer service always said, “this is kitchen department issue. Please contact your kitchen planner.” And surprisingly the only way to contact the kitchen planner was to write email to him but he didn’t respond. Response rate: ca. 1 out of 5 emails. And then we fell into a vicious circle or a dead end to be more precise.4) customer service staff are not well trained. one of them even hanged up the call without advice, explanation or assistance. (Ps. I did speak German to customer service. Very sure it was not language issue)Key Incidents (what went wrong so that we finally understood how terrible IKEA service could be)Incident 1) we booked and paid for the dishwasher through our kitchen planner. Namely, it was in stock when we paid for it. However, the order was canceled one sided by IKEA all of the sudden one day before the scheduled delivery date. And we tried to call customer services. They said “sorry out of stock.” (So what’s the point for us to pay for it that earlier and trust it would be delivered before the installation guys came?) In the end, Amazon saved us.Incident 2) the kitchen planner forgot to make the booking for the fridge. We noticed this issue only one week before the scheduled installation services, which had became urgent. After trying to call customer service many times, we finally managed to get one customer service who could help us book the fridge without delivery fees as this should have been part of our kitchen package. (Btw, the kitchen planner still hid himself somewhere even we had emailed him about this missing fridge. No response still until today.)However, the customer service later called telling us he could rebooked the delivery of the fridge on the same date as other bookings. We said fine. Soon after we received a cancellation email of the fridge but no further rebooking. So we called customer service. They confirmed yes it’s canceled. We asked “could you booked it for us again?” This time, they responded “no can do. Please contact your kitchen planner.” After calling so many times and talking to different kitchen planners from different locations, they all said they could book it but with extra 99€ delivery fee. (yes our kitchen planner was just gone.) in the end, given the installation guys would be coming soon, we ordered it through one kitchen planner and paid for the fridge including delivery fee.And, and, and, finally the installation was finished although some doors are still missing. We happily thought that we would never need to speak to IKEA service people anymore. What a relief…. But the IKEA torture just returned today — we received an invoice from customer service for that fridge they never delivered let alone there’s no Auftrag Bestätigung for that fridge in our email inbox at all…. (this is the last draw to let me decide to write down our story on a public platform.)Thank you for reading our long complaint to this end ;)(Update: Just called customer services - they insisted that the fridge was delivered in \"their\" system. they asked us to go to the Einrichtungshaus again because the delivery was arranged by them. Again, IKEA one-sided decide what to invoice without a proof of delivery, our signature, not to mention there's even no Auftrag Bestätigung from us. How dare IKEA issue such an invoice like that? Their management and integrity are both questionable.)Conclusion: Doing business with IKEA is time and energy consuming at the same time. Think twice before placing any order of any IKEA goods or services."

Live chat disabled due to \"high volume\" (gee, Ikea, wonder why). There was, however a local number. Forum after forum warned me I wouldn't get anywhere with the number but I had to try something. Being patient about \"COVID delays\" could only go so far, man.I was through to a super friendly and accommodating staff member pretty much straight away, who was able to tell me the order had been damaged and placed on hold. Apparently, no one had thought to tell me (cute, Ikea). They were able to offer me either a refund or a redelivery in a short window of time and cleared everything up really quickly.Four stars because this was genuinely a helpful and pleasant experience. Star off because I had to initiate it myself and because it's simply not good enough to have just one contact option in 2021 with so many people looking for work."

It's no coincidence they don't have a complaints procedure (just a feedback form) and don't allow customers to post reviews on certain products!I ordered the Farlov 2-seater sofa bed for £795, which arrived with 2 screws missing and as a result would derail when trying to use the bed function. IKEA's customer services are so incompetent they were unable to send the correct screws to the store or in the post. Instead, they sent round an 'eco master' (engineer) to resolve the issue. Although he was able to replace the missing screws, the bed broke upon first use. After sending another engineer, who confirmed it's broken, I was told I'd be hearing from them soon. Unsurprisingly, after a week I'd heard nothing and again had to chase them.I've spent hours now trying to get a refund/exchange, I'm continuously told lie upon lie by their agents e.g. you'll receive a call within 24 hours, which never materialises. I've now been given a date for collection for a refund (though I have to disassemble the sofa myself), but even this has been rescheduled. The agent tried to tell me the cost of the sofa was £560 when the website and my order clearly states how much I paid. Unethical behaviour.

Did I eat that mixed eace of metal inner layer with the food food an accident?. I speak with IKEA by the phone after call them for 2 days, they offer a replacement and I said that of course I didn't want it, I cannot trust that's not gonna happen again. She offer a refund for this pot which I accept. She's was all the time in a hurry to hung off the call which I found very strange, is given me bad vibes and a lack of trust already. I ask her couple times why I can't out a review in their website on the mobile ikea Web version, she told me that maybe I should try with a Computer. I told her that I tried by the computer option Google chrome gives to mobile users and that still not work, still I cannot write a review. Already I read someone else write a comment about the same problem, that a piece of the inner layer comes out. Why IKEA doesn't let people put more comments?. Anyone else can do it?. Why is not any way to claim or complaint online in the website?. The chat and email and contact options on the website is currently unable because of the covid-19 they have put it there. Honestly, I cannot trust anymore in IKEA for serious things like pots, pans etc after this. Maybe for things I am not gonna eat only. I don't understand why they even aren't able to send me a email or a text message conversation about for what we just speak minutes ago over the phone. I have a reference number after I insist to much and that's it. All the time that lady trying to hang off the phone to me. Very strange and annoying to be honest.

  "articleText": "If I could give 0 stars I would. This is by far the worst customer service I have ever received. We ordered some seat pad cushions for the solleron sofa, a recliner chair and a load of other items which came to near £500 along with a £40 delivery charge. The day before we received confirmation that our order was due the following day between 7-11. We waited in (we booked the day off work especially) and it didn’t arrive. I rang IKEA customer services and the gentleman said on the phone “it should arrive today but might be late. It says your order is delayed” this had not been communicated to us at all via text or email. We patiently waited for a further 4 hours and the items still had not arrived. I rang up and spoke to the same gentleman as before who told me that our order had encounter an error… wouldn’t come today and that some of the items were out of stock. Again… no communication from IKEA. No email, text or phone call. It’s just common courtesy. The gentleman said they would redeliver another day which we begrudgingly agreed to only to be told there’s no guarantee it will arrive on that day and that we would be best ringing up two days before to check it would arrive. Why is that my job as the customer? It is the most basic level of customer service to keep customers up to date on their order. We then cancelled the order and we’re told as a gesture of good will…. That they would also refund the delivery charge. Big round of applause IKEA. Thank you so much for refunding me for the delivery that you never delivered. Oh and the icing on the cake, if our refund isn’t in our account within 10 days… we need to ring and chase that up too. Safe to say we won’t be ordering again in a hurry. I also fully expect that IKEA won’t learn anything from this review as the thousands of others I’ve read on here today say exactly the same and clearly that’s not worked. If you’re thinking of ordering, think twice."

They have dragged out delivering the last few parts of my kitchen for three months now. When calling them, no one seems to know what's happening. When they finally are able to send just one of the items, they will give notice of one single day which means I have to put all other things aside all of a sudden. If I can't make it, the item will be sent back to the other side of the country just to some day, hopefully, be sent back again. So go ahead and take your chill trip to the aisles of everyday value-for-money-stuff, get your meatballs and fries, but never place a bigger order with delivery at IKEA. They have cost me so much time, energy and extra money to the craftsmen at this point, I'm about say forget about it and just live with half a kitchen. But I won't. I won't."

The purpose of our visit was to purchase various items and have lunch.....it was a complete disaster. We approached the entrance to the store with a trolly that was left abandoned in the parking area, the security guard on duty took it away from me stating that we had to get trollys from the 2nd floor near the back of the store, this was not acceptable as I need a trolley for support. We went inside the entrance to find someone to help us, we did, I explained the situation, he found me a small trolly you put the yellow bags on. How can you pick up odds and ends throughout the store without a trolly!!!! By this time I was frustrated and ready to eat and get a coffee...well that was another fiasco we were told we had to book on a phone app  this is fine if you have the capability on your phone which we did not..the girl in the restaurant said she could take our information but there were not seatings until 1pm which wasc45 minutes away, yet very few in the eating area. We then were so upset we decided to leave and give elsewhere putting down the items we were going to buy. I will never step inside this store until they change their format for shopping, what a horrible experience from a well established store that should have done a better job at taking care of the customer."

Starting from ikea cancelling deliveries 3(!) times at the last moment, to them losing my payment and suggesting I should pay again if I want the kitchen delivered in time. Not to mention mixed up order items, key items being removed from my order without any warning and my partner having to spend more than 8 hours talking to customer service to no avail.Almost a month in I still don’t have my kitchen, delivery is delayed again and I have to resolve all issues by myself (including renting a van and travelling to the other side of the country to pick up missing items which they for some mysterious reason cannot deliver anymore). I am boiling on the inside and feel completely powerless because this company does not care about its customers. Some individual employees have tried to help but their hands are tied by stupid protocols.How can such a big company fail so miserably at one of their core businesses (kitchens)?"

  "articleText": "I bought a settee and armchair from ikea in August 2019 and the back legs on both have broken.  I contacted ikea to get a replacement leg which I was happy to purchase but they are not available.  IKEA agreed to send an assessor to look at the furniture to understand next steps, replacement or refund but following my call IkEA are telling me that when I bought the furniture there was only a one year guarantee which was only extended to 10 year after I bought it and nothing can be done  with a broken furniture.  When I followed up with customer service they told me the guarantee was extended as the new furniture is better quality?   Retailing at the same price.  I asked if IKEA knew that what I was buying was inferior quality and that better quality was required only a year later but no answer to that.  Essentially I bought furniture for €1600 that lasted a year and half."

  "articleText": "Today, after having been ignored through the Facebook message channel since Saturday, I resorted to contacting customer service through their online chat on their website.The issue was about a room divider which was showing up as in stock in the Dublin store (which I had also received an email about telling me it was in stock) but when I actually got to the store it was not there even though the live update was still saying 2 left in stock.I was very annoyed as I had paid for my own transportation service to collect this item in store as it was too big to fit in a regular car. I didn't want the same thing happening again when the item came back into stock.But I have NEVER EVER received such bad customer service! Having waited in the virtual queue for an eternity a person named Dovile responded and eventually told me they could ring the store for me before I arrived next time. I thought this was unacceptable and at the very minimum they should have offered free delivery to compensate me for my last failed trip but I was told that couldn't happen.I then asked could they provide the number to ring before my next trip as previously offered and the chat very conveniently encountered a 'system failure' and HASN'T OPENED BACK UP SINCE!! Coincidence..IKEA you have alot of questions to answer. JYSK is popping up all over Ireland and will definitely be taking alot of your business if this is the way you treat your customers."

Ever other colour in the size I need and every other size in the colour I need but for some reason the Black/Brown 100x58 shelf is rarer than Fabergé egg, and no help from IKEA even after a member of staff told me that a supervisor could arrange for it to be home delivered FOC when it becomes available to save me making another wasted journey but when I asked in store I'm told I need to call customer services and customer services say it's not in till July 12th and even then the stock is limited. This has got to be the most idiotic scenario when they're making vast quantities of everything else but this one item is as scarce as the Loch Ness monster."

I spent about an hour until I found the Row/Bin I was looking for in the fourth section I went to, which was Warehouse.Signage and assistance are extremely poor to nonexistent. When I finally got to where the item was supposed to be there were none in the bin, with about 4 other people there looking for the same item. I finally found an Info desk and was told if it was't in the Bin, it would not be stocked until the next day.What a horrible experience!!!! NEVER AGAIN!!!!"

  "articleText": "Okay everyone listen up.  Despite on the website that it says the following statement - scroll below my text. This is far from the truth!!! As I bought a vanity unit which is too big for my bathroom due to my designer getting it completely wrong. I appreciate not IKEA's fault but delighted to find out they do take assembled furniture back, which I think is a really good service and USP. I lugged the whole unit and washbasin and IKEA refused to refund or give me vouchers.  There is this back buy scheme? Which applies to second hand furniture. Admirable indeed, but not good in my case. I am so dissappointed that the reverse was told to me.  Be really careful when you buy things from this Company! As the ample information I found about them accepting returned assemble furniture is not TRUE.  HQ IKEA any chance you can make an exception or bring this policy back for customers? I am now stuck with £200 item which I do not need. Happy to except vouchers.  I am gutted that this policy no longer exists. Bad move in my opinion!SEE STATEMENT(NOT CORRECT)  IKEA does have a great return policy. Customers can return products up to 365 days after the initial purchase, even if the furniture has been assembled. If IKEA agrees that the product is unused and in resalable conditions, the store will issue a full refund.(NOT CORRECT) You don't need to disassemble the furniture before returning it at Ikea. Bring in the items as they are, and make sure you bring all the remaining pieces (and the box as well if you still have it)."

We called IKEA again and were told we would get a call back with a new delivery date, 5 days later no call and on the web sight it said the order was canceled.So another 129 mile trip to Charlotte was told by the kitchen design manager Sam they had it in stock and would take care of it rite now. Finally problem solved, nope. Sam brought the order to me I asked is everything here he assured me it was. My stupid mistake was not checking it, when I got home and brought the order into the house there were 3 items missing.

So we tore out almost everything and left just enough to be a usable kitchen. We decided to go to Ikea for our cabinets because they deal with the European designs. So we went on line, designed everything with there tools and went to the store which is over an hour ride from us. This is in 1/19/2021. The staff helped us put everything in (Several thousands of dollars) and we paid for delivery at the tune of 100 bucks. They said some of the stuff in back ordered due to the pandemic and we understood. They delivered the 1st part of the order which not 1 single thing was available to put together in 2 weeks. They said about 60 days or less and we will deliver the rest of it. We agreed. 60 days rolled around and dead silence, Not a text, call, or e-mail. I called and got a huge run around. Hung up on 2 times and spent over 2 hours on the phone. They said another month and we will have it all. Again we understood. And again dead silence. I called back and was again hung up on multiple times, transferred to more people then I what to do with, and told the order should be in by the 3rd week of May. (5 months now) I called because they again did not even try to reach out to me but when I went on line my order showed CANCELED! This really got me going. I called on 5/26/2021 and got the traditional run around, the traditional hang ups, spent 3 hours on the phone for them to tell me there computer systems are down. They took my name and number and said they will call me back. SILENCE! Nothing.... I called back on 6/1/2021 my day off. I got the 45 minute wait on hold, transferred to 7 people, told my original order does not show up and that the stuff I need to complete my kitchen is still not available even for online orders. I told them I want them to CANCEL this order and 100% refund my money including the delivery fee. We will wait and see if this happens. If I could give a Negative 5 stars I would. I have rebuilt 3 houses, and 2 kitchens. This has been the worst experience I have ever had to deal with. Be weary to deal with this company. Look on the BBB site and see they are a 1 Star business and are not even accredited with them."

  "articleText": "I visited one of the their stores to return a rug that was only bought couple of weeks ago. Item was in perfect order and in original packaging however I could not seal packaging as it was only plastic wrap. A very rude and unprofessional adviser on return kiosk asked me for receipt and when I presented my receipt she started making excused that items should be in original condition etc. I asked her to check item and when she could not find anything wrong she said packaging is open and she cannot accept this. It was a terrible experience and when I asked for a manager she said she is everything. I will not stay quiet and will raise a complaint against this unjust behaviour when on next kiosk all opened items were returned by other people. it was Manchester Ashton Store."

It will take about 14 days for them to credit my card if I am ever able to cancel an order that did not deliver and will probably never deliver.  The order had a delivery date of 5/29/21, no order status was ever available online, and when I tried to cancel the order, the system did not recognize the order number.  I spent well over 17 hours on the phone up until now trying to speak to a representative to get order status.  The few times I was able to get to a representative, I got BAD information.  They confirmed on 5/28/21 that the order was delivering on 5/29/21 and I did not leave my home from 9 am to 9 pm yesterday waiting for the order.  The order NEVER delivered.  I am now on the phone trying to cancel the order.  Almost two hours and 5 departments later, I have not been able to get the order cancelled.  They have not yet transferred me to the \"department\" that can cancel my order.  Is this a scam??????????????????????A manager indicated that, as of today, the order is \"delayed\".  They should have not accepted my order if they could not fulfill it.  This is UNACCPETABLE.  Make sure your order is not going to be \"delayed\" for months before you place an online order.  I've been a loyal IKEA customer for more than 30 years, since before the store name was change to IKEA.  This my last order.  It is difficult to believe that an organization such as IKEA has declined this bad. No organization exists without customers...."

The customer service department did not tell me that I needed these two pieces. On the website, it says it comes in 5 packages, I only received 3. The did not give me the slates or the support beam. So I cannot put my bed together. I’m furious. I called customer service and she told me that I needed to buy the two pieces separately. Nobody on the customer service department mentioned I needed them. I went to them and got the receipt to purchase it and he did not tell me to get them. And same with the people who brought it out to me. Horrible customer service. If the website says it comes in 5 packages, why wouldn’t then give me the whole set. I’m unable to set up my bed now, and I have to go to the store to buy the 2 other pieces. Absolutely ridiculous."

I was put through to what they laughingly call CustomerServices for times and left hanging with no response on the other end. I eventually spoke to someone called Caitlin who spoke so quietly that, with my phone on max, I could barely hear her. I wear hearing aids and had them at max too, to no avail. I had to repeat everything and ask her to repeat herself too. Eventually, she advised that all my information was correct, but it would take 48 hours for the system to confirm it! In this day and age of emails and instant responses, 48 hours for a confirmation seems illogical, ESPECIALLY AS I HADALREADY CONFIRMED ALL THE INFORMATION YESTERDAY TOO,"

  "articleTitle": "TERRIBLE",
  "articleText": "Hi,I am EXTREMELY trustee dated with ikea. I placed an order on March 8th for a wardrobe system to be delivered originally on Saturday, April 10th. I got a call Friday April 9th in the morning saying the system was coming that morning when I was already at work and was unable to be there for the delivery to be made. Later on after hours on hold trying to speak to a representative, I was told the shipment would be coming at a later time. Finally got an email saying the delivery would be pushed back to May 10th. I had my grandma come to my apartment in the morning because I had still yet to receive a call as to the delivery window but the night before I spoke to an ikea rep. And he told me that the delivery was definitely coming that day. My grandma could only stay a half day so I worked a half day and on my way home from I was hit by a van and badly injured all because I was heading home to try to get this delivery. I have a police report filed and I will be bringing this to my local news channel to investigate as to why ikea has terrible customer service and where my wardrobe is because I am starting to think ikea doesn’t even have it. I will also be emailing the CEO my police report for my injury Now after speaking to multiple rep.s and being promised that my ikea wardrobe was brought from a warehouse in Long Island last week that it would be in a warehouse in the city to be put on a delivery route today, I have yet to get any call or email. I paid a lot of money for this and Ikea has terrible customer service. This is TWO MONTHS LATER and I have yet to receive this item. I need this ASAP.I have been telling everyone I know never to purchase from ikea, I will be writing to the CEO, I will be sure to be posting all over review sites as well as bring this issue to my local news channel to do a customer review and investigation with them.I would like a full refund and to be compensated for this issue. I would also like to be contacted by a superior employee to resolve this headache. I am disgusted by the absolute poor service!"

  "articleText": "We have had similar poor quality issues with the Hokassen mattress as in the review below.  Ours is probably worse as the mattress was rarely used, it was only on the guest bed.  The sides have started sagging, showing that the springs do not extend the full width, the foam sides sag and do not support.  I will never buy an IKEA mattress again and consider them very very poor value for money.\"Poor quality, meaningless warranties & horrible customer serviceI purchased a mattress from the Amsterdam location of Ikea in 2018. We went for the slightly higher-end HOKASSEN model, which cost us around €500. After just two years, one side of the mattress started caving in - it appears the layer of foam around the mattress has separated from the core. I contacted Ikea's customer service team about this issue, as their website claims all mattresses come with a 25-year warranty. After weeks of slow communication and lots of back-and-forth with the customer service team on Facebook messenger, they finally connected me to the claims team. They then asked for additional information and photos, only to then reply back saying: \"We have started to process your enquiry and have thoroughly examined your photos. Considering this information, we have concluded that the damage stated is caused by circumstances that lie outside the product itself, e.g. daily use, impacts from dropping or falling, or incorrect use of the product.\" So apparently \"daily use\" is considered a legitimate reason to void the warranty, even though the Terms and Conditions say nothing of the sort. According to the T&C: \"The claim must not be the result of incorrect use of the product, such as dropping it, knocking it over, using it for a purpose other than that for which it was intended, not maintaining it properly, or having it repaired by a third party.\" I replied with this information and asked for further explanation from the services team and never received a reply. So after over a month of emailing about the damage with my mattress, I end up ghosted by Ikea. One of the worst customer service experiences I've ever had. For anyone thinking about buying a mattress from Ikea, be warned -- the mattresses are not made to last and the warranty is worth nothing more than the paper it's printed on.\""

They'd basically just tell me that there was nothing they could do. End result: about 10 hours on the phone (!!), several days of staying home to wait for them to deliver, and several months sitting in a half furnished apartment (I still have nowhere for my guests to sit). The nightmare is ongoing. I still don't have a couch or my money back. I wish I had the means to just have a lawyer handle it."

Turns out it was the fault of the logistics company. Ikea customer service representatives were very helpful once I was able to get through, and the problem was resolved. I still spent several hours on hold, once just to talk to someone on their CS team, again while transferring between departments, and once again while their sales resolutions rep was on hold with the logistics company. Ikea really needs to improve their customer service availability. I spent half my day off waiting on hold for what amounted to one of their reps contacting the logistics company to resolve the issue. That could have been handled by email or an automated system with way less stress for me and their CS team, but the only way to contact Ikea is by waiting on the phone to speak with one of a limited number of representatives."

All the couches were hard and uncomfortable and my bummy boo hurt and now I think I will need to go to the doctors about that. Don’t waste your time going to IKEA it has nothing of value it’s all useless. I was also looking for some storage units for my tickly woos bedrooms but you have to put the stuff together yourself and no one does it for you. They expect me to waste my precious time putting something together that probably doesn’t even look good, like the staff who served me. Another thing I bought was a chair. I ordered it online and when it came it was completely the wrong colour and covered in stains, who knows what happens to that I was disgusted and it made me feel anxious so I had to visit my comfort place Waitrose.

  "articleText": "We Purchased a Kitchen from Ikea last June and following many attempts to make contact eventually had the first part delivered at the end of July. Some more was deliverd in late August and the balance was never delivered. We luckily only paid for each consignment as it was being delivered, but this eft us with an incomplete kitchen. No worktop, some appliances missing, and a missing drawer. We subsequently purchased the worktop and appliances locally in Wexford. BUT found out to our horror that while these were standard sizes when we installed the integrated dishwasher the IKEA door didn't fit. We have a hole visible when the door is opened on the dishwasher where the hinge  would be if it was used as a swinging door. The Kickboard under the units is stepped back from where the dishwasher Kickboard is. This has ruined the look and finish of our kitchen, The salesperson we dealt with when ordering our Kitchen no longer replies to our emails and advised us when she did last reply to order off the website, Very unsatisfactory. It has left us with an unfished Kitchen and very frustrated. So buyer beware if purchasing a kitchen from IKEA. And ensure it will fit in with and appliances you want to purchase elsewhere. We had tried to purchase appliances from IKEA but after 6 months we wanted to try move on and get the kitchen Finished"

Well let’s say that is vague but I waited. Soon after that I get a message stating that they would be out for delivery between 12-4. Getting better! Around 10 am I get a call saying they are about 5-30 minutes from delivering my bed ordered. About 1pm I get an email saying that they can’t deliver. I call customer support and they said the driver said that the road was closed and cannot make delivery. Now I don’t know where they were coming from, but the main road to where I live is wide open and they only tried one way and that didn’t fit their driving schedule. How about taking a day off work and waiting all day for a delivery that isn’t happening cause you may have ran into a small roadblock. IKEA stated that it’s a third party delivery service they use. I do not trust you any longer ikea! I took a day off and the best you say is it’s a third party. You really have lost me as a customer. I hope that anyone that reads this will also take that into consideration cause their about making their money and that’s all.

  "articleText": "My partner and I booked and paid in full for an IKEA kitchen with customised laminate kitchen worktop. This was for our first house. Kitchen and worktop were both supposed to come on 22.04.21. They sent us an automated email few days before delivery stating worktop would be delivered on 27.04.21. On the 27th the worktop did not arrive, after calling several times, with agents saying different things, they realised this worktop was lost. 4 days later, I received an email stating they found the worktop and after that, I received a call stating they had found it but they realised they had ordered the wrong one.At this point, we had already moved in a house that still does not have a sink, a hob and a dishwasher installed. We are eating microwaveable ready food and washing our dishes in our bathtub.Another order was made this time with delivery on 25.05.21. Few days after, this order was cancelled. With no explanation on why. No one contacting me to tell me what was happening. Yesterday another order was made with delivery date for the 4th of June!!! This means that IKEA has delayed my worktop for 44 days. This means 44 days without a drop of water in our kitchen. We found some panels to put on top of the cabinets that as they are not sealed, lots of dust goes in the draws.So far no one of customer service has contacted me. No calls no emails. Except for a lady of the kitchen department. She's sorry but she cannot do anything about it. This is  not very helpful is it?!IKEA has transformed what should be a joyful moment such as moving in your first ever house in an absolute complete nightmare. My partner and I have families and friends who either live abroad or in different areas of the country. With the ease of lockdown, we could not wait for them to come and visit us and share some meals together on our new house, but this cannot be done until June the 4th. If this worktop gets delivered and no one else messes up with it again and again and again."

I asked why would I remove tags on the bottom of a chair that no one saw. Kept telling them they shipped it that way.Second, they said it was altered. It wasn't. Per them, I used it so it can be returned. I had it for a month and yes sat in it to see if one it would be good enough and two because I thought the wheels just needed a little time to loosen up. To them, this is altered and they can't resell it so they will not take it back.I asked about the 180-day return policy and was told that is for open boxes never used.They gave me 3, not 4 other wheels that didn't work either.

My mom is trying to handle these bags, this women attacking her, and my 4 year old niece who’s trying to run around. While the lady is yelling at my mom, holding her, and demanding a receipt even though she JUST went through the line my mom decides to make a complaint with the manager who called the police and put her out the store because my mom raised her voice because she disregarded her and her complaint.

You don’t put your hands on ANYONE, nor go through their things without an explanation. You are not the police and being a women of COLOR you would think they understood that and could’ve just pulled her to the side and requested the receipt instead of yanking my moms arms like she’s a child, while she’s trying to make sure her grandchild is not running out the door and into the street"

The reason that amused me and forced me to put this feedback is that he made a statement ‘Nobody forced you to order from IKEA, It was your choice’. Last I remember I paid for the delivery and the products as well, If it was free I would have accepted. I don’t have any information on the tracking either. Please listen to the call recording and give him the feedback he deserves. I wish I could cancel the order and not deal with IKEA anymore. Never expected to be treated this way by IKEA.Order ID: 383212088I would be keen to know if ikea takes feedback seriously.Thanks,Mathew"

  "articleText": "I ordered an Alex Drawer Unit online and I made the mistake of back spacing and accidently making two orders. I ended up canceling one order and picking up only one. I was charged 3 times and refunded once for the canceled one. So Ikea charged me twice for the one I picked up. It took two hours to get it resolved and a refund. The lady told me call back if I don't get my refund in 7 to 15 days. So I called back and this lady yelled at me and called me a liar. You never yell at a customer or call them a liar. She said her system doesn't show the third charge. I told her I have been working in an office for 20 years and computer software's can make mistakes and be glitchy, she said not ours. I told her it is a computer they make mistakes. I told her I didn't remember my case number but every job I worked at we had a a computer system we log conversations in that we have with clients. She just kept arguing with me and calling me a liar. I asked for a supervisor and she said  there is no supervisor. It was resolved eventually but Ikea needs to  hire more professional people."

However, she did a little more research and went to look, came back with nothing. Did more research and somehow by the grace of God they had the exact leg in the exact color in the back of the store and swapped it out for me so I wouldn’t have to return the whole thing.

Husband used scrap wood to try to assemble furniture. Called store back and they said no order for missing hardware was ever placed. I was told to recycle or dispose of furniture and they would issue refund. Five months and a dozen calls to customer service later I still have not gotten refund. I disposed of unusable furniture, as directed by Ikea, so I am without needed shelving unit. Customer service has a script that they read that means nothing.

We were given a new date and told the old mattress would definitely be collected and the new one definitely delivered.So again we dragged the mattress down the stairs, waited in for another day.

So we were given today's date.And again today we've brought the mattress down and waited for nothing to come a third time.Shocking service.

I called Ikea twice and finally got through to someone who told me I have to wait 7-10 more days. IKEA is 2 hours away so I offered to drive their but they couldn't get ahold of anyone at the store. My advice is to go to the store and dont order online. Save yourself 100 delivery make it a family trip with the 100 and you will wind up not spending all the money and have fun for a day.

They told me my product would not be back in stock for two months and I could either receive a refund or re-order. Asked for refund. It then took TWO months to receive the refund, after 3 calls made into customer service again. I had one phone call where I waited only one minute and of course the two others were over 30 minute wait times! Finally received our refund today.. ONLY HALF OF THE REFUND was put into our bank. Tried to call back again today regarding it.. 30 minute hold time - had to hang up and will be calling back tonight when I have more time. VERY DISAPPOINTING DEALING WITH IKEA FOR SURE."

  "articleTitle": "My Ikea Adventure:",
  "articleText": "My Ikea Adventure:For a company this large their customer service is beyond awful.Here is our IKEA experience:We are trying to purchase the PAX closet system in white; we live north of Tulsa Oklahoma.First I get on line and try to order the system and just go pick it up at the store.Their system will not allow for me to accomplish that. I try calling the store. I am on hold for over an hour, get transferred 3 times and then disconnected.So, we take a day off work and drive the 5 plus hours to Dallas. When we get there and find the Pax system displays we had a hard time finding an employee to help with ordering what we needed. However, when we did get help, her name was Christina and she was the best thing about IKEA. She knew what she was doing and was extremely helpful in designing the closet system to fit our closet.As luck would have it they did not have all of the pieces we needed but we could get close if the Frisco, TX. Store had the corner unit that the system showed in stock. It took over 45 minutes for her to get to talk to the other store to check stock. She got them to reserve the corner frames for us. She rings us up gives me the ticket for their store and a ticket to pay for the items at the Frisco store. Now they have you pull around back to a numbered parking spot and text them that you are ready for your items.A young lady comes out with 2 carts full of boxes, stops at my truck, looks at the ticket and then leaves. Never comes back. So, apparently you have to load your furniture in the truck. Thankfully I am in good enough shape and not handicapped or elderly.We drive to the Frisco store. I go in and ask a lady at the cash registers the best way to pay the ticket. She points me to a self-checkout. After I pay the bill I ask her if I have to pull around to a dock like the other store. She tells me “I just started here and don’t know” and walks off.I go over to an in store counter with my ticket and ask the young man there the same question. He points at a TV screen, then my ticket and tells me “See these numbers, when they come up on the screen we can help you”. Okay, so it’s another 10 minute wait. My number pops up, I had them the ticket and they give me oversized boxes on a small cart and walk away. So now I get to push this cart thru the store and across the parking lot to my truck without the cart flipping over or the boxes sliding off. This time I am rescued by my wife who held the cart still while I wrestled the boxes into the truck.Fast forward to today – 5-4-2021I get online and try to order the 2 frames and the shelves that were out of stock. Surprise, the website won’t calculate delivery. I go to the chat box help. What do they recommend – They tell me I need to just go into the store instead of trying to order online and that they think the system must just be backed up and the warehouse is too busy to accept orders right now. I didn’t even bother to tell them it’s a 5 hour drive to go in the store.IKEA has some really nice things and the prices are not horrible but if you don’t live close, you just have to hope when you get there they have what you were after because you sure can’t check any other way."

  "articleText": "I made an online order that never arrived. Since then I spoke to 4 different @IKEA Customer Service staff on the phone – which only happens after enduring a long waiting time. After these time-consuming attempts, none of them can actually explain what is wrong with my order. Each of them tells a different tale. I don’t know who’s actually telling the truth and no possible solution comes to sight. I am just told to wait. Cancellation could be an option but only for half the amount paid. The worst is that we cannot speak nor contact anyone from the IKEA store, there's no accountability. The only point of contact is these intermediate \"staff\" that know nothing. Very sad and frustrating."

I have contacted customer service and got a suggestion to buy the tabletop again and Ikea will pay back delivery cost afterward, I had to trust Ikea and wait 2 weeks more, I ordered a tabletop on 23/03_2021 for the second time, BUT Ikea has canceled my order again, even though Ikea sent me a message that I should expect delivery between 08:00 to 11:00. I'm still waiting to receive the transportation cost. I contacted customer service and they suggested me \"go to one of our shops and buy it yourself\", I did on 27/04_2021 as I can not trust Ikea's online service anymore. BUT after opening the pack at home I can see that there is a big crack under the board, what can I do now??? why I have to pay for IKEA's worst service 3 times just for a desk???"

  "articleText": "If you are wondering why #ikea has the worst customer service rating, this is a good example:I was just trying to buy and get delivered furniture for 2 rooms for our village house...After 1 month of trying to order online I realized that half of their products are always unavailable online, but available in the store...I don’t give up :).It’s Good Friday and I have 2 hours between my 14m old baby naps, so I decide to go to the store and order on spot.I arrive at the parking in the very “family friendly” store, I have to carry my not so light baby around until I find shopping cart or someone to direct me to such.Yeahhh, finally I see one next to the entrance, but behind the bars...and since there is noone to direct me, I wander around for 15 min trying to find a way in the store with the trolley and I see a lady going up with the elevator. I follow and I end up at the EXIT.There for God knows what reason there are 2-3 security people - so noone at the entrance, but everyone guarding the exit.I am told that I can’t enter and I need to go all the way back, leave the trolley, carry my baby all the way up and eventually find one trolley there. All these while another lady that just went out is allowed to get back in right in front of me...I am told “these are the rules”, but I didn’t understand why they are valid for me and not the other lady, so I ask to see the manager.After 10-15 min two ladies come out to explain that Ikea stores all around the world are badly organized and you have to carry around babies or you can take your own push-chair and push both and “these are the rules”.Well, I confirm I understand their rules and I will consider going to Ikea with my child next time...However I am already there for more than 30-40 min with 14m old baby getting impatient, so would they be good to let me in, Mrs. Julia Mihaylova with the most cold blood look and tone said - these are the rules and went back in through the EXIT.I guess this day, those rules were valid only for mothers with babies - not for other customers or employees...So after I lost my 2 hours, I finally gave up to buy this furniture from #ikea..."

Not only my order wasnt complete and I didnt receive any notification about it, but also one part of the wordrobe I ordered was seriously damaged inside the box, without the box being hit. That means that part was put inside the box already broken.I called the customer service in order to come and replace it, but they told me that it is my responsibility to tranfer the part all by myself back to IKEA Odense. I would never imagine that something like that would happen with such a company, it is unacceptable and shows no respect to the customers, especially when it is not their fault."

I received no communication after that even though the confirmation email said I would receive communications about the delivery a couple days prior. The boxes showed up a day before delivery date with no communication. They were packaged incredibly poorly with the rug sheddings making a mess and the candles I had ordered wax all over the place where I had to vaccume everything. Then I was missing two items. No communciation about this. When I went on the website it just said at the bottom of my order that there was a refund for an amount that added up to these two items. It would have been fine if I had received communications earlier about these items being out of stock but I received NO communication. And I have no idea when I will receive this refund either. I have called the Customer Service line and they have assured me that I will receive the refund in 14 days but IKEA really should improve it's communication and customer service."

I have been working with IKEA for the past month and a half to see if I can get my wardrobe, so that i can use my shelves that are useless without the wardrobe frame. Spoke with 4 different people, 1 hour apiece and the end result was \"this frame is unavailable for delivery in your area, so the only option for you is refunding the PAX wardrobe\". So I paid $50 for shipping on an item that was not delivered and have 6 shelves that I paid $60 for that are absolutely useless. Why was I also allowed to proceed with the items within my cart? I can be refunded for said 6 shelves, but have to send them back to IKEA and pay shipping myself. WHAT? Will never be buying from IKEA again."

For the high price of delivery, I would expect a much better service.When trying to contact them about this, I realized they don't have a CS email address, the live chat is not working, they don't pick up the phone.So I have contacted them via FB Messenger.They have answered once, asked for all my details and then silence, so I got no meaningful answers.I don't know when IKEA sunk to this depth, but this is really pathetic.Every professional company has a CS email address in the 21th century and you are an international company not an Instagram celeb.We have no other choice, but to turn to customer protection agencies.Sad.EDIT - 2021-04-30:Today I have received the replacement items and one of the items were damaged again. Out of 4 boxes in total, which is an achievement.It will take another \"5-7 days\" to get this one which makes it more than a month waiting for this order.It would be great if IKEA, if it is really needed at all, would delegate delivery to professional companies who actually know how to handle wares.This is ridiculous."

  "articleText": "EVEN ONE STAR IS TOO MUCH FOR IKEAI am writing this review because I really don't want anyone else experience my frustration with IKEA.I went to IKEA to buy some furniture on finance for my new place 3 weeks ago.One of the staff walked me through applying for IKEA credit card to be able to buy them on finance and I got approval and she provided me with a paperwork to give to cashier at the check out.She told me that I would be eligible for a 6 month promotion if my purchase is under $600 but it would be eligible for a 10 month promotion if my purchase is more than a $1000.So, I decided to purchase some furniture for a total of 1,251.00.The next day, I received  welcome emails from IKEA regarding my IKEA credit card, so I called them to schedule payments to prevent possible interests.The customer service told me that I was only eligible for the 6 months promotion and not the 10 months.I was frustrated but I decided to put some pressure on myself and pay it back in the 6 months. Then the customer service lady said that she couldn't not schedule any payments until I receive the physical credit card by mail in a couple of days.After 2 weeks I received the credit card and I called them right away to set up an auto payment.The customer service who was a gentleman apologized me saying that the IKEA staff had made a mistake and she had put me on another IKEA credit card that had no promotion. He suggested me to go to the IKEA location in Costa Mesa California where I purchased the furniture to explain the situation to their customer service and he said that the IKEA staff could call the contact number on the back of the credit card to help them to get it fixed.So I took another trip to IKEA in Costa Mesa.The customer service couldn't help me ,so they directed me to their supervisor, her name is KYLIE.Although it was absolutely their staff mistake, she aggressively told me that she couldn't help me unless I apply for the other credit card with promotion then she would  process a return/refund  on my receipt and she would put them on new card with promotion. I accepted her offer but it was just the beginning of IKEA's trap.She said that she wont be able to process the return until  I return all the stuff back to IKEA.I told her that they are all assembled and I have also paid for their assembly so she just needed to do the process on the paper without returning all those furniture back but KYLIE said that the furniture should be returned, also she will not even refund the whole money back because the furniture had been unpacked.Also, I couldn't buy my furniture back any more.It means that I needed to return furniture to get paid for part of my payment ,then I could apply for the other card, then I would go back to store to buy them all unassembled again.I AM STILL SHOCKED OF IKEA'S CUSTOMER SERVICEIT IS SAD BECAUSE I REALLY FEEL BAD WHENEVER I LOOK AT MY FURNITURE THAT I GOT FROM IKEATHIS WAS MY FIRST AND IT WILL BE MY LAST EXEPERIENCE WITH IKEA AND I EDUCATE MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY NOT TO GO THERE"

  "articleTitle": "BAD EXPERIENCE",
  "articleText": "02.06.21  - We bought 3 large items and some smaller ones. We live 2.5 Hours away from the store. We were told by a store rep that the 3 larger items were in stock.  When we went to receive our large items, we were told that two of the items were located too high and couldn't be brought down until after hours and we could pick them up the next day. I argued a bit and stressed the fact that we lived 2.5 hours away, brought our truck which costs $50.00 a trip. No help there.02.07.21 Returned to the store to pick up the 2 items. We picked them up and went home (2.5 hours - or 5 hours round trip) for another $50.00.Upon arriving home removed all parts from one of the units and began assembly. Found a side of the cabinet (part) that was not constructed correctly. Being Sunday, I opened the other unit (same item) and it had the correct part. Completed assembly.02.08.21 Called customer service, spent 2 hours, one on hold, explaining the issue. Was asked to circle the part in the assembly manual and take pictures of that and email them to the customer service person. I did so and verified with the person that they got the email. She said the part would ship in 3 to 5 days to my door.After 2 weeks + of waiting for my part, I called the customer service line again (another hour on hold) and the person I spoke with said the part was too large to ship and that I would have to return the bad part to the store and they would open the box so I could get the correct part out. Part being the side of the wardrobe, requires my truck to transport.  At this point I was infuriated. I called the Merriam Kansas store to verify that they had the wardrobe in stock and drove (2.5 hours) to the store bringing the bad part in. I explained the issue to the customer service rep and she said it would be a few minutes for some one to bring the box down. 35 minutes later, I asked about it and she disappeared then returned with the 2 boxes. I explained that the part was in the large box and removed the smaller one from on top of it. She starts cutting the box open with a standard box knife, which, since the package says, no cutting (picture of a box knife with a circle with a line through it) I assumed she knew what she was doing. Nope. Put cut marks on the outside side of the wardrobe part. I was extremely upset, didn't say anything except, 'oh, you cut my part'. She offered to get yet another box down. At that point I took the part and left. I decided I would switch places with the other unit and the side with the cut would be against the wall.SO, I will NEVER buy anything from Ikea again and suggest NO ONE else does either. Furniture quality is 'OK' (3 out of 5) Service is EXTREMELY incompetent and I am out an extra $100.00 because of 2 extra trips to the store that I should not have had to make."

  "articleText": "My first experience at IKEA will be my last. Saturday, March 20, 2021, I drove an hour and a half from my home to IKEA. I was so excited for my first time, as I am a huge lover of interior design and home decor. I went in after some research looking for some clear dining chairs. I fell in love with the TOBIAS chair and had my mind set on getting them. I looked on the website that morning to confirm they were in stock before my drive. After walking through the showroom and grabbing some additional cute things, I went to go and grab the chairs. I find the aisle and bin only to find bottoms and not the tops. I look around to make sure they weren't misplaced and go and ask a team member for help. I looked again on the website, where it showed there was still availability for them. He looks at his tablet and it shows inventory on the chairs are 14. He walks me down the aisle and says, someone might have bought them and forgotten the bottoms that more chairs would be in on Monday. Disappointed, I returned to the showroom to see if any other chairs would work. I saw about 6-7 of the clear TOBIAS chairs on the floor and thought I would ask another team member if those can be sold since I made such a far drive. Again, to my disappointment, floor models cannot be sold unless they are discontinued. She said they can be ordered and shipped to my house, to go back to the self-serve warehouse and have someone build an order for them. I spoke with a manager, who waived the delivery fee, and said I can come pick them up the next day, Sunday, at the store, that they were getting another shipment. So, one person told me Monday, another told me Sunday, the website shows availability on the chairs, and the inventory on the team members tablet showed availability as well. There is so much inconsistency. So, I go ahead and have the team member order the chairs for me to ship to my house since it was a far drive for me. The team member guaranteed the chairs would be delivered by Monday. I hadn't checked my email until Monday morning, to see an email from IKEA, excited, hoping it was shipping details. No, it's an email from SATURDAY, the day I put in the order, stating they are out of stock. The day the team member ordered them for me. So easily my money was taken but they weren't even available. AND to this day, I’m still waiting for them to return my money for them. I am appalled, disappointed and so unsatisfied with my experience with this company. I will never recommend or shop here ever again. Ever. This is so ridiculous."

The delivery driver said he doesn't know anything about these items even though they are on the same order form.  On top of that, I scheduled Task Rabbit through Ikea's partnership site to assemble these items tomorrow but am missing half of my order!  Finally, their delivery contractor wore NO face mask - quite the safety risk. To add to this horrible experience, I have been waiting for over 1.5 hours on the phone for customer service, only to be told that all they can do is cancel the order and have me restart the entire process (which I will not do)."

The customer service at that store is also definitely below par and the employees make you feel like you are annoying them. I ordered 2 pillowcases and a dish brush. It has been almost a month and I’m still missing a pillow case. I have called 6 times to get updates and the only 2 emails I received for the order confirmation and to let me I was getting my partial delivery which I actually thought was going to be complete. The phone agents have been very pleasant though.I can’t believe how little effort they put into keeping you updated. Everything I have found out about this order has been because I had to call and ask. I have even been on hold for more than 45 minutes on one call, when my situation was escalated. I hung up eventually.I think on top of my disappointment, I am also surprised because being that the situation in retail in so dire,I would think a company would try to hold on to every customer they have.  Even the phone greeting for customer service tells you that they most likely won’t be able to help you.It’s so sad 😞Please send my pillowcase. I’ve already paid for it."

  "articleText": "Dreadful.  Bought a simple light fitting online.  Had to wait one month for delivery.  Item delivered (cost of delivery almost half the price of the item) and when delivered found to be broken.  The packing, done by IKEA, was entirely unsuitable for posting.  I am elderly and about 50 miles away from nearest IKEA.  IKEA's 'help' page suggests taking item back to shop, which of course is closed during the pandemic.  I have no means of getting to a shop anyway. With difficulty found a phone number which provided a lot of options except for a person to speak to -- no one ever picked up the phone.  Online information said phones were answered until 20h00, but at 18h15 a recorded message said phone lines were closed. The frustration is astounding, deliberate and the whole process is unhelpful.  There is no easily accessible support from IKEA and so I will inevitably be stuck with a broken light fitting that can never be used."

  "articleText": "The sofa itself actually seems like a good product. However it arrived with no covers after we paid for express delivery. When I called customer services I was told this was a supply issue and they didn't have the product in stock and it would be another week and a half before it was sent. I questioned why I hadn't been told this when I ordered and was told that even IKEA don't know the item is out of stock until the customer calls up to say it is missing! What kind of logic is that?! Seeing the many other 1 star reviews here it seems this is standard practice. I asked for a refund on my delivery costs which was refused. Mind blowing how little care is given to customer service. Useless"

  "articleTitle": "Terrible service",
  "articleText": "I love Ikea as a brand, but here, in US, they work so bad!!!!!1) When I wanted to order a couch through the website, I put it in the cart, but then, when I tried to pay for it, it said \" out for delivery, try later\". After a few days of tries I gave up.2) So we ordered other things and decided to call. First manager told us \"oh, yeah I can make an order for this couch, it will be delivered in about two weeks\" and sent an e-mail with the bill. We payed, but then received the second email \"wasn't paid, try again\". We call AGAIN (FYI, every call you wait AT LEAST AN HOUR AND A HALF on the line). Another manager told that \"sorry bla bla bla.... we can try to order again, the delivery will be in ONE MONTH\", explaining that there is a long list for delivery service!!!!! WHAT?????? One day ago it was two weeks. We asked can we just pick it up in the store, she said NO \"because the store (in Miami) and IKEA storage have different locations. FML!!!!!3) In the store, in Miami (1801 NW 117th Ave, Miami, FL) a manager explains that they don't have one part of the couch in the store, that's why we couldn’t order online pick up service. WHY do they basically show an item if you can not buy it????When we ordered other stuff using the same manager helping, the bill that he gave me wasn't able to be paid, and we were walking back and forth from one manager to another waisting our time!About the couch, they suggested to come in a few days to check maybe they will have it.....4) FINALLY we ordered online having a delivery in three weeks. Today is supposed to be the delivery day. At the website zero information on WHEN it will be delivered and zero contact from ikea on the day of delivery or in advance of this date. We called AGAIN just to know at least a time window. A lady answered and redirected us to another department when we were waiting on the line 1 hour 15 minutes and the call was dropped!!!! We called AGAIN, another lady answered saying \"apologize\" and redirected A-G-A-I-N!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     WE ARE STILL WAITING ON THE LINE!!!!!!Conclusion: DON'T USE IKEA DELIVERY SERVICE IN FLORIDA!!!!!! TERRIBLE!!!!"

  "articleText": "I bought a sofa bed on January 6th with delivery and assembly, but the people who came to assemble it, were not able to do it properly, indeed the part of the sofa that makes the sofa become a bed did not stay in its position but goes off the rail that makes it stays attached to the chore of the sofa. I called customer service to fix the problem. Two weeks later, two guys from the Ikea assembly group came to my house with the intention of fixing the problem with this sofa, but even this time they were not able to solve it. I called the customer service who told me earlier that they could not replace the sofa for lack of trucks for delivery but they could come to pick it up to make the return, then I checked on the site of ikea.nl and there were possibilities to replace it. So, I called them and they told me that they would take charge of my request for annulment of the return and they started the replacement request. On the canceled day set for the return, 2 guys came to my place for taking the sofa back but I explained to them that it had been canceled, then I called the customer service of IKEA Netherlands that was not able, from March 8 (date of annulled pick up) to exchange the sofa. They told me to send them the pictures of the problem and explaining what was the problem with the sofa. After having sent the pictures I had to wait two weeks for the inquiry to be processed. Today, March 29, the weeks have passed and I called Ikea Netherlands to have an explanation about it and the lady on the phone answered me arrogantly, and while I was talking she threw me down the phone.I think I’m going to report it to the police."

  "articleText": "Ordered a month ago, was emailed the night before delivery, and the morning of, with a confirmation time the truck would arrive....They never showed! No contact from them regarding why it never showed, or to reschedule delivery. Trying to contact them is pointless....They wont answer emails, and disconnect your calls after waiting for hours. They must be making quite a bit of interest off the money they are holding on to, when they obviously don't have the items to sell, despite them being marked as in-stock when ordering, and saying they are in a truck on their way to you.....For such a big Company like IKEA to pull this kind of crap, is absolutely disgusting!!!!!!!.......This is FRAUD!!!!!"

  "articleTitle": "Failure to deliver within their obligations and dreadful customer services",
  "articleText": "We ordered a Superking mattress and paid £50 for 'express delivery'. We were given a delivery time on a Saturday between 7am-7pm. We tracked the delivery and could see the vehicle was about 7 miles from us.  a couple of hours past and nothing arrived. The message we got when we checked the tracking again was 'we are unable to deliver your item' We tried to get through to customer service but to no avail. The following day after holding for 40 minutes we finally got through to then be cut off! Called again another 30 mins on hold and finally got through to a customer services representative. We were told 'they had not got the correct item on the lorry', we asked 'why we had not had confirmation of this and were shocked when they said 'they would not have contacted us and it was up to us to contact them!!'. If this wasn't bad enough, they refused to refund the £50 we had paid for 'express delivery' and offered us a £10 gift voucher!!! We appreciate things go wrong but to refuse to refund the 'express delivery charge' when it was their fault is absolutely outrageous. Vey little in a way of apology and the represented said we would have to wait another week for delivery.We will be looking at Ikea's legal obligations under their 'express delivery' contract to assess any liability, but all it would have taken was a 'we are really sorry for your inconvenience' and 'we will of course refund you as it was our fault'.A real shame as Ikea offer excellent products but badly let down by their dreadful customer care!"

And to add, I was expected to collect from only 4 stores, the closest being Croydon AND the other 3 outside London as far as Southampton! Why! Try it I urge you! So, I put in a postcode further away i.e. Enfield Town, a couple of miles further away from me. Low and behold any item was now available for collection. Why are you not allowing local people to collect fromm the store? This is discrimination. How dare you."

I took the photo for a malm dresser’s tag (actually didn’t Understand some notes in that excepted price). I had other dresses that I saw online, and I showed to a staff in there to ask how I could have that items. He gave me a map and wrote down the note about area that I could find them. I asked him wrote down the area for a malm dresser also, but he refused, he said that I had it in my phone (the malm dresser’s tag photo). And he repeated the same sentence when I asked him again. What is the heck’s service? I went to shopping with 2 kids, 1 hand for stroller, 1 hand for his map and hand for my phone and eyes on my kids? That’s the way Ikea treat customer? I just needed a paper with all area’s information I must come to pick up. It is really difficult for him or I required too much? So terrible He is.

I spent almost an hour on the phone with the customer service call center. Warning: They do not know how to take care of customers. They simply answer the phone. I received more misinformation including a FAKE FedEx tracking number. I guess they just want to quiet down the customer who is expecting the service that IKEA has promised. My no-delivery issue was escalated to the \"resolution department\" which is a joke because NOTHING was resolved except the fact that customer service at IKEA just doesn't care about the customer. I left a message at the corporate (USA) office - the recording says I will hear back within 24 hours. Let's see. Until then, zero resolution, no one knows where my product is or when it will be delivered, and \"customer service\" has upset and disappointed a customer. DO NOT order from IKEA online. Be warned."

I'm so exhausted after this experience....sitting here in tears and thought I'd warn others.How do they get away with treating their customers like complete garbage?1. First, they nickel and dime you for every single item. That translates into multiple deliveries and an entire garage full of individual boxes.2. They insist you inventory every item before you make an appointment for installation. No one explained this process at all. It took me plus 4 of my neighbors 3 hours to complete the items inventory.3. I ended up making 4 trips back to the store for missing or out-of-stock items. They charged me for more items than I needed, Other items that were needed they never include.4. The installation happened in the 2 days promised time however they charged for every single extra cut they made to the sum of over $500.Every trip made to the store was one frustration after another with absolutely no help from store associates. At the end of the day, if you're considering a large purchase you could spend the same amount at a well-respected company that cares about their customers and appreciate their business."

Says email is not available. So I initiated a chat conversation, and was told I had to call in about a refund. So then I had to call and wait on hold forever. I had to email a photo of the broken item. Was told I would get a full refund. Checked online and was only issued a refund for the item cost, not the shipping cost. So I had to call again - waited on hold yet again - and then the customer service agent couldn’t open the software for 10 minutes. She then told me IKEA doesn't refund shipping costs - even for damaged items! I told her that’s unacceptable - why should I pay for their mistakes and products that break? Then the call was cut off. So then I had to call AGAIN. Was told that IKEA phone calls are internet based and the connection often doesn’t work. And then I was transferred to yet another person - even more time on hold. By this time I’d lost count of of how many calls I had to make and how many people I had spoken to."

  "articleText": "I’ll never buy IKEA anymore!! Terrible service!! IKEA treat their customer like a garbage , at least for me!!  I ordered whole kitchen from IKEA. The worktop is customized product, they need to produce it specially for me. Normally take four weeks. But firstly, because they didn’t communicate well with their third party (construction company ALLOM), I got delays for my worktop. It made me wait for extra two weeks. Then delayed one more month because of lock down. It’s not end. When finally on March I got my worktop of the kitchen, it has a huge damage. Then I need to return and they redo one for me. It takes another one month. In total I wait for 5 month for a worktop!!!!! Plus during the whole process, it’s always not easy to contact them. No one pick up the phone and the attitude was like this is not my responsibility please contact someone else. Now I’m asking compensation for that. They are saying the delay is because I ordered it again their advise! Excuse me?? You send your worker to measure everything and you didn’t communicate with them very well, something went wrong, you said it’s my fault?? It’s unbelievable! They don’t want to take any responsibility and treat me like a garbage!! And They are dragging it on and on. if I didn’t get compensation within a few days, I’ll fight for my right until end! I’m trying to get some legal advices right now. It’s just not right!"

At the beginning of January I made an order that was meant to be delivered to my on 11th of February (when the shop was meant to resume its work). I know it's a long wait, but on the other hand - the whole country was on the lockdown, how were they meant to deliver any of my goods? Obviously, I wasn't expecting my package to be precisely shipped on 11th of Feb. Just think about the amount of orders they probably received before my and after. Anyways, once the shop resume working, I got a text saying that the delivery will be postponed and then a week after another text with an information about my package and the shipping estimate time."

  "articleText": "How difficult can it be to buy two office chairs from this company.  Order placed online for two office chairs, arrive at the Tottenham store collection point on the 10th (50 mile round trip) but only one chair is available along with the arms for the other chair.  The man handing over the delivery makes no mention of the fact that items are missing from my order.  I take the one chair and additional set of arms home and call IKEA the next day to sort out the delivery for the missing chair - wait on hold for 50 mins whilst being tortured by ABBA played on a loop.  Finally someone speaks to me and they confirm the missing chair will be delivered to my home address on the 16th, and a confirmation email is received from IKEA.  Another email is received from IKEA today advising \"So, we're just getting in touch to remind you that your order 1176333133 is still waiting for collection today - and we want to make sure it gets safely to it's new home\". from their Tottenham Store. I ignore this email as I know the chair is being delievered from Peterborough on the 16th.   Then later today I receive another email with an Invoice attached and the delivery date on the invoice is the 20/03/2021.  I call IKEA Customer services to find out what I should do next; do I  a) go to the Tottenham Store, b) wait in on the 16th as arranged or c) ignore a and b and wait in on the 20th.  Customer services cant find any documentation on the system regarding the Tottenham pick up or the delivery date of the 16th and confirm I should wait in on the 20th.  The only reason i ordered these two chairs in the beginning was because they were both available for collection on the 10th.  If you want a stress free purchase do not buy any furniture online from IKEA unless of course you like listening to ABBA on loop and sitting on the floor until you furniture arrives.  UPDATE: Ikea have just emailed me without warning confirming they have now cancelled the rest of my order.  I now have one chair and two sets of chair arms I don't want. WELL DONE IKEA - STICK TO THE PORK MEATBALLS FOR EVERYONES SAKE PLEASE!!!"

Also your inventory planning leaves customers frustrated. 5 weeks ago purchased a child’s bed (sniglar) that requires Luroy boards to make functional. Luroy were out of stock but I bought the sniglar and the mattress thinking that Luroy would be available soon. A well run company would make sure customers could by all 3 components required to use the product. I’m 5 weeks in and looks like I’ll be waiting at least 4 more weeks. In the meantime my daughter is sleeping on the floor waiting for IKEA to get their act together. Every night I remind her that she is sleeping on the floor because IKEA is a poorly run company and she should always aim to be better when she starts working. Trying to make it a life lesson:)"

The refund was fast, including the shipping cost.On 25th February, I went to IKEA website again and noticed that there was a change in their order page. I thought “why dont I give Ikea a second chance” so I ordered again and to my surprise, the estimated delivery day was 4th March, which means only 1 week waiting although my order was small and the shipping fee was only 2.99€ (big difference comparing to the previous order in January!). Order placed.On 2nd March, an email from Ikea announced that they are picking my order. On 4th March, nothing came but I already expected this would happen. On 5th March, an email from ikea came to say that due to peak time, my order will be delayed 2-5 days. On 10th March, they emailed me my order was sent and I got the Postnl track&trace link, I was quite shocked tbh 😂. Today (11th March), my order ACTUALLY CAME. Well done Ikea Barendrecht!This time is a very good shopping experience from Ikea although the delivery time was still a bit late. I guess after all the bad feedbacks Ikea is working hard to improve their service and they really have some good changes. The quality of Ikea products is good with reasonable price, they just have some weak points in their logistic department but they are fixing it. Once again, my compliment goes to the staffs of Ikea Barendrecht, Netherlands :)"

They had a page to order missing parts I tried to add all the screws that were labeled on the guide book only to find out there's a limit to how much you can order.I AM NOW ORDERING THE PARTS OFF AMAZON, THANK YOU IKEA FOR BEING A GREAT HELP. NOTTTHERE IS NO CUSTOMER SERVICE ONLINE OR ANY DETAILS TO REACH THEM. So in future if you would like to order flat pack furniture try Wayfair instead.Edit - 3rd April 2021After buying the missing screws and finding the assemble guide book on their website, I've realised they have given me the wrong panels to make the storage unit. We have tried to contact them but it's only a robot who repeats the same thing.This is terrible service and I can't believe I paid £40 service delivery charge for this. It's going on the next bonfire, at least I'll get more use out of it that way.I will never be using Ikea ever again.FYI - If you want a storage unit without having to pay for service delivery charge try Argos, they have some great furniture on there right now and next day delivery. - Wished I knew this before wasting my money on bloody Ikea."

Postage for my previous orders have been £4 and £3.95 which I thought was fair enough. Then I went to put through another order last night and standard delivery was £15, I am absolutely disgusted. I have sat on the phone for ages listening to ABBA (guess it could have been worse) and asking me to be respectful to their staff when I got to speak to them which was never. I live in Northern Ireland and to visit our IKEA shop would break Covid rules and as I haven't been in a shop for almost a year now that's not going to happen. so I am appalled that individuals like myself are being penalised in this way. IKEA should be ashamed of themselves taking advantage of vulnerable people at this time."

The foil construction is lightweight but also lightweight in sturdiness with a maximum 50kg load weight.

  "articleText": "If a major, multinational corporation cannot adjust to Covid World in over a year—AND THEY HAVE NOT—their corporate management team from CEO on down should be FIRED. Since 2003, I have spent literally thousands of dollars on a variety of IKEA products at the Conshohocken PA store because the products have always been a good value and customer service had been excellent. Customer service is now too lean—you’ll wait 15 to 45 minutes for help on special orders or even just basic questions. Quality still seems okay but AVAILABILITY and DELIVERY are still a freaking nightmare. In fact, availability is even more HORRENDOUS today than it was 6 months ago! What was amazing today was the MEGAPROPORTION of products that carried NOT AVAILABLE tags. When you drive an hour one-way expecting to buy items advertised online and they’re not available—or this is a good one: yes, it’s listed online but it’s a new product and we don’t have it yet! And when asked an associate what was going on, he admitted that they’d been struggling but they were hoping (hoping?!?!?) “to be back to normal sometime in June.” Freaking June??? This is one UNBELIEVABLY INCOMPETENT CORPORATION! DO NOT BOTHER DRIVING A LONG DISTANCE TO AN IKEA STORE—I guarantee you will be disappointed!"

The delivery men knew the box was torn open and didn't check to see if any parts were missing before delivering. I had a handyman in that afternoon, and had to go buy the missing parts from Leylands... yet to be reimbursed for those missing parts. Had to ask Customer service to call the driver, to see if parts was still in delivery lorry. No proactive action taken; just reading out the T&Cs to me. Not customer service fault, but would be nice if they tried to solve the issue.Order 2:  Pay £50 for \"named delivery day\"; not delivered and not in contact (even though email states that they will be in contact if any delays).  Call on 3 separate occasions, only get through to Customer Services on 3rd attempt (total of over 3 hours on the phone).  Customer service let me know that part of the sofa is missing. If I hadn't called they wouldn't have been in touch, and would have let order slide. Reimburse £20 of £50 delivery charge... why not the full amount? Seems bizarre. Customer Service Staff was very polite, but couldn't answer as to why it had taken me to get in touch with IKEA.Take your money and let you deal with it."

Others have had damaged goods delivered and cannot send back as unable to contact customer services.Recommend that you AVOID IKEA until their stores open again. Even at that point, expect a large queue of disgruntled customers ahead of you. Shop elsewhere with companies that value their customers."

Total nonsense !!!  they send a product that smells disgusting, but I have to pay for their error.  This is not about liking it or not, it will be a refund entirely due to the fault of the seller. Also, I do not understand why I am returning a product I bought online from the store.  Their stores are also closed.

After repeated emails and calls also they don't bother to give resolution because they have already collected money from me. Now they don't care if I received the correct order or not.

  "articleText": "Exceptionally bad service has been par for the course for me at Ikea for several years now. I've had orders canceled without knowledge of the fact they were canceled, waiting like a chump on hold for hours on end trying to sort things out. Requesting supervisor intervention, being told they will call me back followed be an email that supervisors are too busy to talk to the likes of me with my little concern.Yesterday was like any other Ikea customer service experience I've had. After waiting in a long return line a week ago to return an item purchased during a lockdown, I did not have the exact method of payment with me. I was told that they will put it on a gift card and that so I didn't have to wait in the long line again that I could just go to any checkout till and get the gift card placed on my original method of payment. Ha, suckered again!!! Went to a checkout till to attempt what I was told I could do just a short week ago and was very abruptly told no. Requested a supervisor, was told no. Requested the customer service supervisor to discuss the error that will now take even more time from my day, was told they were too busy.  I informed the supervisor, that I would wait for the store manager to discuss. The store manager comes over with the so typical puffed-out chest syndrome to tell me the same thing. I requested that he assist me in performing the buyback of the gift card that I never wanted to begin with and he told me that I should wait in the hour-long line again!!! Naturally, I asked to speak to his boss, and he told me that he was the boss. I asked him, four times over if he was the boss of the store and if there was any above him I could speak with. He told me, that he was as high as there was... right now. So I dumbed it down for him asking him if there was a flow chart of Ikea and look at a flow chart for this store with the hierarchy, you would be at the top every day of the week? Finally, he conceded and told me he did indeed have a boss. I will call the store today, I'm sure to waste my breath and time as I will not get through to his majesty, and even if I could be told to screw off anyway. Thank you, Ikea, for once again teaching me why I shop at places like Costco, with exceptional customer service policies. You guys are hands down one of the worst stores for customer service in existence!"

Was promised a refund. Nothing materialised. Called again after a week and a half, was told the refund would be in our account 3 days later. Nothing materialised. Called them again and was told we were being fast tracked for a refund, would receive it in 5 days. Nothing materialised. Called them again after two weeks. Got about five seconds into the call and got cut off. Called them again, was put on hold while they \"read my case notes\", was on hold for half an hour. Each 5 calls meant 5 hours of listening to ABBA, fed lies, lies, lies, mixed with unending incompetence, AND they're still holding onto £496 of my money. Beyond furious.This is criminally negligent service and I have now been forced to threaten IKEA with legal action to recover my monies that they are illegally withholding.I will NEVER EVER buy anything from IKEA ever again and they do not deserve to survive in the modern retail landscape. Their attitude towards their customers is utterly contemptuous and I believe a great many other people now share the same feelings."

  "articleTitle": "Poor quality, meaningless warranties & horrible customer service",
  "articleText": "I purchased a mattress from the Amsterdam location of Ikea in 2018. We went for the slightly higher-end HOKASSEN model, which cost us around €500. After just two years, one side of the mattress started caving in - it appears the layer of foam around the mattress has separated from the core. I contacted Ikea's customer service team about this issue, as their website claims all mattresses come with a 25-year warranty.After weeks of slow communication and lots of back-and-forth with the customer service team on Facebook messenger, they finally connected me to the claims team. They then asked for additional information and photos, only to then reply back saying: \"We have started to process your enquiry and have thoroughly examined your photos. Considering this information, we have concluded that the damage stated is caused by circumstances that lie outside the product itself, e.g. daily use, impacts from dropping or falling, or incorrect use of the product.\"So apparently \"daily use\" is considered a legitimate reason to void the warranty, even though the Terms and Conditions say nothing of the sort. According to the T&C: \"The claim must not be the result of incorrect use of the product, such as dropping it, knocking it over, using it for a purpose other than that for which it was intended, not maintaining it properly, or having it repaired by a third party.\"I replied with this information and asked for further explanation from the services team and never received a reply. So after over a month of emailing about the damage with my mattress, I end up ghosted by Ikea. One of the worst customer service experiences I've ever had.For anyone thinking about buying a mattress from Ikea, be warned -- the mattresses are not made to last and the warranty is worth nothing more than the paper it's printed on."

  "articleText": "It's a shame i have to give one star really as I don't think they even deserve that. I ordered some furniture for delivery and paid the £50 fee which, according to their customer service who I had to wait on hold for 45 minutes to speak to after my stuff didn't show up, is not to book a delivery. I always assumed that when I paid for a product called a delivery i was paying for an item to be delivered to me but according to ikea that is not the case, just what the £50 fee is for then, i still have no idea.The customer service representative i spoke to was one of the rudest and most belligerent people I have ever had the misfortune of speaking to. Taking pleasure in making customers cry is apparently their main job as it definitely wasn't to find a solution to the fact my items \"were never put on the truck\". He refused multiple requests from me to be passed over to another customer service rep and told me that if I insisted he would simply hang up the call. After 45 minutes of listening to the atrocity that is Abba compressed to play through a phone line, you can understand why that made me even more upset. He also informed he was the only one who handled complaints and that he was refusing to put in my complaint. This was, of course, a lie. I eventually managed to convince him to rebook my delivery for a few days later but on ending the call, he simply cancelled the entire order instead.I then got to spend even more time on hold to speak to another customer service representative who did manage rebook my delivery but it really makes you question just the kind of business ikea is running where these are the kind of people representing their business.I still received no details about my deliver and even after a call at 6pm the night before the second attempt the customer services could not confirm my items would arrive the next day. They did eventually arrive but with zero information from ikea.In total that weekend i spent over two hours on hold waiting for ikea customer service, I assume this is down to the sheer number of people they have failed who are calling to try and get what they have paid for.I am nothing but disgusted with the way ikea have handled my business and will not be using them in the future and I suggest you do not either. I have made multiple complaints and am yet to receive an apology, although they did eventually refund my £50 not-delivery fee."

  "articleTitle": "Do not order an IKEA dishwasher",
  "articleText": "I ordered a Finputsad dishwasher (\"which?\" gave it good reviews). They didn't deliver when they said they would, but did deliver a few days later.When it arrived, some of the parts (the door attachment brackets) were faulty. I contacted customer services to try to get some spares, but they don't stock spares for their dishwashers! They messed me around for a week: The first customer service person I spoke to arranged for a whole replacement dishwasher to be delivered, with a note attached that they were only meant to deliver the loose parts. This order was later mysteriously cancelled without informing me. When I noticed that the order was cancelled, I contacted customer services again. This time they told me, after searching around for a bit, that the dishwasher was manufactured by whirlpool, and that I should contact whirlpool directly for spare parts.I phoned whirlpool on the number they gave me, and they told me they don't know anything about the dishwasher in question and don't recognise any of the numbers I read out from the service sticker.I phoned IKEA again. This time they said they would contact whirlpool themselves and get them to contact me once they'd worked things out (Still not what I actually want: I just wanted some replacement parts, not to chat to a whirlpool employee).At this point, I was really regretting ordering this dishwasher. Even assuming they managed to rectify the original order, who wants a dishwasher where the manufacturer denies it exists and nobody sells spare parts for it? I phoned IKEA back to request to return it. They tried to charge me a £25 collection fee to pick it up. According to them, a faulty dishwasher is classed as, \"customer changed their mind\", unless whirlpool have first visited and tried to fix it (which they aren't going to do because they don't believe it exists).If you're looking for a dishwasher, I would look for a reputable brand who support their products and sell spares, not a reseller like IKEA.If you're looking for anything else, I would still suggest avoiding IKEA, as ordering and arranging delivery was a horrible nightmare."

  "articleTitle": "Disaster Kitchen Process",
  "articleText": "We began our Ikea kitchen design last October and it is now mid February.  After purchasing the parts needed to build our kitchen, we have been met with a series of errors and crappy compromises.  First off, we have an average sized kitchen and ordered basic cabinets and they still never got the order straight.  We paid $79 for an official measurement and that measurement was incorrect.  The excuse was new staff....  After 3 deliveries of random goods, delivered to the sidewalk in front of our house, we also had to go buy more parts and return wrong parts 9 times within a month and a half.  All during a Global pandemic and no phone payments or orders taken.  We had to travel south 40 minutes each time, go into the corn maze and pay and then drive 5 more miles east to their warehouse for pick up.  Our final plan shows the upper cabinets going to the ceiling but when they were building it out we were told that was not an option/not part of the plan?  We used Traemand because supposedly they know how to build Ikea designs but they proved to be a huge disappointment and were a integral part of the confusion with all the conflicting parts we ended up with.The final straw was that they built one whole side of our kitchen incorrectly.  We could not open our fridge because the wall oven and microwave area was too close to the fridge door.  Keep in mind we gave the Ikea designers and Traemand all appliance cut out dimensions in the design and build phase.  The only resolution Ikea had was to have Traemand move our cabinets on that wall 2 inches to the right.  This required that our countertop on that side be removed.  American Marble works in conjunction with Ikea kitchens so we used them.  Ikea would not agree to anything unless we came into the store once again and pay an additional $1300 dollars for a new countertop, in the event they could not use the original one.  What could we do?  we were stuck with appliances that could not be installed!  We paid thinking they could reuse the piece since it was a simple cut that only needed to be shortened 2 inches on one side.  Traemand came back out and all fits somewhat but the appliances still look crowded on that side so not aesthetically pleasing.  While waiting for American Marble to reinstall, they took forever to get back to us, insisted on a $225 measure appointment for that minor adjustment that could have been done on site.  When I finally called and asked what the delay was they said the countertop for that side needed to be remade and it would be another 2 weeks.  At this point I lost it.  I questioned why they needed to replace that piece and they said they didn't know (I'm just a scheduler).  I guess it's easy to just press that button and buy when the expense is on another person.  After sending a nasty email to the trio (Ikea, Traemand and America Marble), I was told by American Marble that they could actually reuse that countertop piece after all.  Still 2 weeks to wait for a half hour install.  I still haven't gotten a response from Ikea.  Also, the Traemand carpenters had to Jerry rig an area on that messed up side so when Best Buy came to install the wall oven and microwave with trim kit, no go.  It doesn't fit.  Traemand excuse was we didn't use Ikea appliances.  Funny appliances are all standard sizes and we weren't told any of that when we gave them the cut out dimensions over 3 months ago.  We since hired a Task Rabbit to come and resolve their screw up.  I can't wait to have to go back into Ikea and try to get a refund for that additional countertop we paid for,  The moral of this long story is you get what you pay for!  I chose Ikea because I love the modern look and the price seemed good.  In the end, it would have been better to see out a more professional, quality cabinet designer and builder.  God knows what I will be paying for therapy and blood pressure medication in the future!"

IKEA's systems are hopeless. Cancelling an order because we didn't collect it even though they didn't tell us it was ready until the following day is worse than useless. Texting us when we'd called on arrival to tell us to wait (when they'd already cancelled the order!) is even more worse than useless. Don't bother with IKEA during lockdown, people."

  "articleTitle": "Do not use Ikea on line service",
  "articleText": "Ordered some Billy bookcases. The order came in bits so no idea if bits were missing. No way on web site to send email asking for info and when I tried to ring I gave up after 25 minutes. Then last order delivered damaged. again tried to contact Ikea for replacement and again held on phone for 25 minutes before I gave up. tried the so called AI help but that was useless. If Ikea want to do on line they need to up their game considerably. I would strongly recommend no one tries to order on line unless you want to take the risk that you will be very disappointed. Oh and £40 delivery charge is a bit steep as well."

  "articleText": "today I had the absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced in my life.  I'll start at the beginning...we just built a house and need to furnish it- spent  a few hundred bucks last week on 2 pax wardrobes and a dresser- purchased them online.  We liked the product so I decided to go buy a unit that would cover my master bedroom wall.  Did my research online and went into the store to confirm my ideas and to buy it to bring it home.  Talked to the 2 sales girls, one was totally not interested and brushed me off to someone else.  The second sales girl talked me out of a wardrobe system and suggested i buy a living room set instead, it had drawers and it would leave an open space for our bedroom tv.  I told her the most important thing was to be sure it was on site as I have very limited time and I needed my crew to build and furnish 5 bedrooms, a living room and a rec. room within 7 days before I go back to work.   I needed to get it there asap and didn't have time to waste.  After going with her recommendation and assurances all items were downstairs and there was ample stock, I left to go get it.  Surprize surprize, many of the framework wasn't even in stock.  Changed it all to white instead of black and after getting those carts filled, they too were short on stock, one frame, 13 drawers and 2 doors.  After 7 hours, and starving (was supposed to only be an hour- 2 max, I started loosing it and spoke with a lovely manager who was very helpful but it was still a mess as now I had to come back tomorrow to get another frame and had to get a delivery of the rest of the items march 4th.  Extremely upset and starving, I was so frazzled, I put the incorrect pin in for my card (was the only card I had brought)  My bank is over an hour away and it was not 830pm so I was unable to go to the bank to fix my card and make it back to the store in time.  My phone was out of power and I was incredibly stressed out.  I asked the manager to please not put my stuff away and explained what happened and that I would be back first thing in the morning to pay for it without any issues.  The bill was just shy of 1800. which I was very happy with, but it was 4 carts and took hours and hours to get together let alone the stress I endured getting it together.  She had the audacity to complain that she had been working for 13 hours and she absolutely refused to keep my order together for me.  I asked her just to hold it (not put it away) as It took me soo long to gather it and she said NO!  She knew what I went through to gather it all (I explained it to her) and she still said NO!  I am disgusted and absolutely IRATE!  How could you possibly treat your customers that way after what you put me through in order to get it!  HOW COULD YOU!!!  Ikea, you don't deserve good/loyal customers!  I glad I discovered how awful you truly are before i furnished my whole house.  I would like to hear how you could possibly justify the way you treated me.  Shame on you! Please respond"

On delivery day, today, called first thing to check it was being delivered, I was told there were no issues and to expect by 7pm. Throughout duration of the day checked a few times and saw no update on the order page so at 5.15pm I called again. The CS guy was really quick at seeing what the actual problem was (back order) but said the system doesn’t flag it very well but agreed the lady this morning should have been aware of it. Was offered part of order to be delivered 4th March but other items since my order was paused had gone out of stock. So now waiting for cancellation to be processed. Just going to wait until I can collect for free. Never ordering online again."

Then got an estimated time slot (3pm-7pm) at 21:40 .On Friday I received a text message at 7am to confirm time slot (3pm-7pm), another text message at 2pm to say they're nearly there and I can click on a link for an up to date delivery time.Phone call at 14:25 from delivery truck to say they would be there within the hour. Another phone call at 15:08 to say they'd be 5 minutes.Then just after that, two lovely men from the Gateshead Ikea store came to deliver all our items. Nothing missing from 40+ items from different departments.Glad I took the risk to order, given the recent slew of bad reviews. Opted for delivery instead of click and collect as it seems there are still problems with delays etc. but obviously I don't have any first hand experience of that. Even with the delivery fee of £40, still saved money on things that would have cost a fortune elsewhere."

The payment went through and I was told to wait for confirmation before collecting. No confirmation came. I forgot about it until early this month, and went online to cancel the order and get a refund. The cancellation wouldn't go through. I phoned the helpline, was on hold for nearly an hour, then a very helpful lady processed the cancellation for me and a refund was issued. I reordered the items online, this time for home delivery. The package arrived today and it was missing two items, though they were listed as enclosed on the packing list. I phoned the helpline again, on hold for 20 minutes, and another very helpful person arranged for delivery of the missing things. They should arrive next week.This is obviously not how we expect online shopping to work these days, we're used to much better. I really like IKEA and worry all this time and energy spent having to fix things is totally unsustainable. I shan't buy online from them again, it's a shame."

They said no they will the deduct delivery charge, but they eventually agreed to a full refund after much calling back.

  "articleTitle": "Ikea charging customers and not delivering for months",
  "articleText": "I know that there are many posts on the topic but I want to share my experience and warn people. I am placed in New York City. I had read about Ikea problems in the US, but I foolish thought that in January 2021things would be better. I was wrong.I placed an order for 4 items (Finnala couch and Ottoman, Micke desk, and wall mirrror) on January 20, 2021. It took me weeks to manage and place this order as before everything was out of stock. Delivery date was February 22, 2021. A long time, but I decided to go for it. Yesterday, suddenly the delivery date was changed to March 22, 2021. An entire month later. I contacted them through the phone. Hours only to be given contradictory information. I talked to a manager that basically blamed everything and anything in the world as not to explain what really was going on. Today, the delivery date was changed again to APRIL. I called them again. Frustrating phone call where the \"manager\" I talked to dared to be very disrespectful. Again, no answers. They keep saying they know nothing and there is nothing they can do as if it is normal to charge people and then not deliver the merchandise. I could explain in more details the conversation with them, but I feel drained.These are hard times for everyone. It is hard to find the money to place these orders so that we can at least be comfortable in the apts we are stuck in. Ikea fraudulently sells items they do not have and keeps their customers' money for months, and know they can get away with it because they are this global potency. Then, they blame their failure on \"things being hard\", like they are your local bakery. This company is disgusting and I wish I had the resources or peace of mind to actually take action against them.Please be aware that even if items are said to be in stock and you pay for them and a delivery date is set, they actually don't know if they have those items and the delivery date will keep being changed, month after month."

The biggest waste of my time in the world. And so frustrating with trying to schedule when to be home so they don't leave my package on the streets of NY. Doesn't matter though, BECAUSE IT WILL NEVER SHOW UP.Customer service told me 1] it's in stock at all of the three Ikeas around me. 2] They have no idea why it hasn't been delivered. 3] They can't confirm anything. 4] And then she got sassy with me when I was trying to be extremely calm.EVEN WHEN I GOT A CONFIRMATION CALL THEY MOVED THE ESTIMATED DELIVERY BY A MONTH. ORDER ANYWHERE ELSE.I will NEVER shop at Ikea again after this situation. Do yourself a favor and go to Wayfair. Best customer service and delivery. Go to Target.

But then a item is missing, can also happen but what happens after that is really bad. Responses on support request take for ever and days go by with out a reply. Finally the missing product is shipped, another month goes by (By now you should have sorted things out) and even this is worse,  it should have arrived the 4th of feb. But I only got it today. This means I have waited for over 2 months to get my full order and what even makes it worse is the your service really sucks. Sorry for the words but I can understand the logistics hassle from selling almost everything offline to online but what I can not understand is the lack in service and response. And also the quality of response is bad and caused a lot of extra messages to get to a proper solution.Just wow Ikea, you really messed it up and have lost a lot of faith."

Staff were yelling numbers at customers who didn’t really know what was going on, and therefore it ended up being a bit of a mess. 1 hour and 30 minutes went past and still no sign of this order I was told to collect. (I have spoken with staff, they are aware) I get a phone call from the IKEA office saying their has been a problem with my order and to go and wait in the car, which we did...20 minutes later I received another phone call to say your order is ready, so we returned back to bays, and we received the order. The IKEA team had really given me no reason to trust their ability at this point so I double checked all my items, and to my not surprised self one of my boxes for a set of drawers were missing, we went back to the bays and then had to wait another 30 minutes for the final box. A total of 2 hours and 20 minutes to collect items. I understand it’s difficult times during the current situation but if you can’t create a simple process that works for customers then frankly don’t bother, and also it would be nice to give your customers some shelter (create a waiting area that is still outside but under the lip) whilst waiting for 2 hours in the stinking cold during a life threatening pandemic. 👌"

I received an email advising me that the credit had been issued. 12 days later, it has still not posted to my account. And calls and emails to customer service have done nothing. No one will provide a transaction number for the credit. All they will tell me is that the credit was issued and it's not their problem that I have not received it.

  "articleText": "I ordered a screen from IKEA which was due to be delivered last Saturday 13 February, between 2 and 6. On Friday 12th Feb, I received a text confirming delivery. At 2.45 on Saturday, I received another text saying it wasn’t going to be delivered that day but 15 days later, February 28th. I also got an email confirming my order.I phoned IKEA and was told that a truck had broken down and up to 70 deliveries were affected. So, what did IKEA do? Hire additional transport to ensure the goods were delivered? No. Prioritise my delivery? No. Send a taxi with my delivery? No. IKEA did absolutely nothing other than give me ‘the next available slot’ for delivery, which was convenient for them, but did nothing for me as it’s over two weeks late. I now have to wait a further 15 days for my delivery because IKEA are too stingy / incapable / uncaring / miserable / disorganised to arrange transport. You can make your own choice, I’d use them all.Interestingly, Customer Service did make a virtue of sending me a €30 voucher for my inconvenience. We are in lockdown and delivery alone is €35, so even then I’m at a loss should I decide to make a purchase.Perhaps if IKEA spent more money on customer service and delivery and less on ridiculously pretentious ads, they might have provide better service and have a better reputation."

Nowadays, you have to sign in and you will be assigned a table number. The only thing we noticed, is that, the tables being used are mostly congregated in the same area so, out of curiosity we asked the staff on why the tables by the window side are not being utilized, his answer was that there is a bird in the area. We asked for the manager and the manager said there is, yes, a magpie in the window area that is why they did not serve on those tables. Maybe the magpie is infected? or will cause chaos? and people will panic? or maybe poop on your meal? or fly? or land? or sing? we were unfortunately assigned on a table that everybody has to pass by us, front and back and yes, I felt unsafe and rush my meal. As I was gathering my plate to put them on the tray area, a lady staff asked us if we were done to get the table number, obviously waiting.So i didn't hear any chirp, maybe the bird was asleep.

  "articleText": "I purchased my kitchen from IKEA Berlin last year. Two items from the order were missing, but I was able to replace them at Bauhaus, so I asked IKEA for a refund. I never heard back from them. After 2 months of replies without any response, I filed a claim through PayPal (which I had used to make the order) with full documentation. PayPal completed the refund on IKEA's behalf. (It was about €100.)In January, I received a written demand from IKEA that I pay them the money I was refunded. I emailed IKEA and PayPal about this. IKEA told me to ignore the letter as they had made a mistake. Today, I received a second demand threatening me with legal action if I do not transfer the ~€100 to their bank immediately.I have no idea what to do as clearly one department is not talking to another. I'll give them 2 stars in lieu of 1 because the quality of IKEA products is at least reliable and consistent, and because I know that 2-star reviews are taken more seriously than 1-star reviews. But this situation is unbelievable. I had a €120 gift card for IKEA and I'm tempted to tell them to take the gift card value as \"payment\" because I will not be shopping with them again."

I order $3000 worth of kitchen cabinets some from store inventory and most from warehouse. The warehouse delivers but the store cancels my store order. No notification, I just learn this from contractor who alerts me that items were never delivered. He tells me store order cancelled by IKEA.Here's the outrageous part and where a class action suit could be successful. IKEA does not credit my card when THEY cancel. No. They make me wait on the phone for an hour and ten minutes to get to a rep who then develops a case number for \"request for refund\" and says it may get processed in a few days.Sorry but if a store -- not the customer -- cancels and order it has an obligation to immediately charge back the card. It is totally unreasonable to expect the customer to have to fix this overcharge issue. In my case it was over 500 bucks so I waited and pursued. Many smaller purchasers likely do not bother.My guess is that many people do not ever get their refunds given the hassle of having to chase for it. Hence their is likely a class of people who have been screwed. Lawyers... there is an opportunity here I am quite sure."

  "articleText": "I live 50 miles from IKEA went there Jan 20th. Purchased what I thought  were 2 pillows wrapped tight in plastic. Once home I opened one and saw it was a matress cover. Was upset because I matched the number of the item to the number of what I thought were pillows in the rack while I was in the store. There were no sales persons about to help me know for sure what I was buying. So, today I went back to return these items and was told sorry, no we won't take it back because there is hair on the one that had been opened. I was surprised to hear that because something like that has never happened to me while returning something to a store. So I called customer service to see if I could get anywhere with them and was told by the representative to take the hair off using Scotch tape. I was dismayed by what he expected me to do and told him so!  He then   schooled me saying \"would you try to return clothes with hair on them?\" And he spoke over me while I was trying to talk. Now, had I purchased it online and returned it through the mail, there would have been no questions asked it would have been returned without an issue.  Because I went to the store and the item was visualized by the clerk I was denied the return.My opinion of IKEA has now dwindled. No more shopping there for me.  Very poor customer service and return policy.  I'll buy my products elsewhere."

The process was, I had to accept delivery of ALL the items, book return of incorrect items (once delivered) and then ARRANGE REPAYMENT OF THE OVER CHARGED AMOUNT. Then, after 2 weeks... I CALL AGAIN AND GET TOLD I needed to go through an automated process to arrange to get MY MONEY back and it would take 7-10 MORE days to process.When I stated that my experience with Ikea had been really SH**tyI was told not to swear or they would hang up on me! GOOD ONE, that’s the way to apologise for causing so much inconvenience.I was over charged when an Ikea employee made an error and then have to wait a MONTH to get my money back.Oh and the kitchen I bought is crap too... so the whole experience really is worth zero stars."

Do not purchase any items through their website or through phone!First, purchase through online did not working at all-either out of stock or server problems! Second, when i call customer service they told me they do not deliver but only pick up on very far location! when I finally placed the order and paid online, they did not even email me back for order ready to pick up. When I called them, after waiting 30min, they switch me to different departments to find out what happened, finally, they said they did not received my payment!!! I emailed them my bank statement to proof I already paid! they promised me i can pick up next day. However, the item-ready email never showed up! so i called them again, this time, they told me they need accounting department to investigate why they did not received payment. Now after one week past, today, I finally finally received their call, saying they found out they DID received the payment, HOWEVER, two of my items are out of stock!!! I asked why it out of stock , because they were in stock when I placed the order!!! now, because their system problems and after one week investigation items all out of stock! who's fault???NEVER, NEVER place order online or through their customer service phone! the only way is go to their store and pay while take out the products. After been with Ikea's royalty customers for many years, I'm now  so disappointed their service!"

Didn’t hear from them, so I called today and was informed they no longer stocked the cushion and had emailed me.  Well, that didn’t happen and I told them I hadn’t received an email.  She said she’d make a note of that.  So, I have a cushionless ottoman and a $10 refund on the way in 7-10 days.

I wasn't in a hurry, the items were way cheaper that similar ones on regular online stores, so I took the chance. After that it became quiet. I didn't get a message on the status, no updates appeared when I checked the order status on the Ikea site. Nothing. After 2,5 weeks I received the message that \"unfortunately\" my order was delayed by 2-3 days. Nonetheless, the order status remained unchanged and the expected delivery date also didn't change. 5 days after the (still expected) initial order date was due, I received a message that my order was about to depart the Ikea warehouse. The day after I received the message form the local mail service that they received my package and that they would deliver it the next day, which they did. It took exactly 4 weeks to travel the whole (virtual) 15,5 km, a whopping 22 meters per hour!I received the items in a huge box, which was filled for 95% with packaging materials. Not really environmentally friendly either.WARNING: NEVER ORDER ONLINE FROM IKEA!!!! (Unless you don't mind to wait 4 weeks for delivery)"

  "articleTitle": "IKEA Ireland - Delivery never arrived after receiving text, no contact from IKEA",
  "articleText": "I ordered items on 1st January 2021 that I had tried to order since October 2020. In store they said they’d be in stock on 1st December 2020 but they were not. I checked online every day and finally they were in stock on 1st January so I ordered and they took my money in full. They said they’d be delivered today 30th January 2021.I then received a text message yesterday, 29th January 2021 to say my order would be delivered today between 11.30am and 4.30pm. It said on the order confirmation email that I would receive an update today to say between what hour it would come and I waited in all day for the delivery and no update from IKEA. I rang IKEA at the end of my four hour delivery window and was told it was ‘out for delivery’ but the delivery truck was delayed a further hour and they’d get them to ring me. I waited until 5.30pm and rang again to be told the items were not only, NOT out for delivery, but they are no longer in stock and she has no idea when they are coming back in stock and can’t even tell me when they will come. So they have my money but do I even have an order.So they clearly send automated text messages to tell people of deliveries when they haven’t even processed the orders. They don’t then have the courtesy to tell customers the order wasn’t processed and isn’t being delivered, the contrary is true they send a text message with very specific delivery times. They then lied on the phone. Most professional delivery services can tell if things are out for delivery and communicate this to customers. Most companies don’t take money in full for out of stock items.Was it even in stock when I ordered or did they allocate my items to someone else. Can they not update me by phone, email or text in the meantime (a month) to say they do not have the items.Customer service the first time clearly lied and on the second call was unapologetic and cannot even give me a date when my items will be delivered. Someone may contact me by email when they get a chance she explained!!Don’t hide behind covid for such poor communication and customer service.Why send the “out for delivery” misleading text to infuriate customers and make them stay in all day for non existent deliveries."

However, I didn't receive any contact from the delivery team and nothing arrived on the day.I then received a lovely message the following morning from customer service apologising and explaining a computer error had occurred. She gave me a new delivery date (a couple days later) with an option to call and change if this was not convenient.I received updates mid morning on the delivery day to advise of how many drops were before mine, then a call from the delivery driver 5 mins before delivery. The two delivery chaps were very friendly and efficient and the boxes arrived in perfect condition. After reading recent negative reviews I felt compelled to leave a positive review. Although there was a miscommunication to start with the problem was dealt with quickly and the customer care was excellent.Delivery was within one week. I think IKEA have addressed recent issues."

I eventually resolved this. Then foolishly ordered another lot of furniture with a lamp that has arrived today and the lamp is smashed. I CANNOT get through to Ikea at all. The phone line says 'sorry we are too busy at the moment' then cuts you off. There is no email complaints line so I cannot return this item. What do I do!

I called the company to find out why it’s taking so long and the associate claimed that they only have one office to handle all of the claims from customers for the entire North America continent. She said my cousin hasn’t even begun to process! Should take 30 days before it’s even processed and then another week or so to see it in my account. What bs is that!?

Design is almost exactly the same, no negative impact and the order/delivery problem is solved. On top of all that Yvonne is so chipper and helpful.

The shipment was also missing some smaller orders and they have not issued any credit note for this. There is zero communication about the missing packages and they are unreachable via phone and facebook.

  "articleText": "Towards the end of December I ordered a Hemnes bookcase and Hemnes Chest of Drawers for delivery for early January.  Whilst I thought the £40 delivery was a little steep, I didn’t mind paying due to the current pandemic.On 4th January (my delivery date), only the bookcase arrived. The delivery driver assured me this would be noted and the chest of drawers sent at a further date. Two days later I had still heard nothing and checked the website. It told me both items had been delivered. Every time I rang (after eventually finding the number) it told me the lines were too busy, no one responded to my Facebook post, my tweet or my emails. Eventually I got through to someone who explained that the system hadn’t been updated and they would resolve this. I was given a new delivery date for later that week.On the new delivery date, only 2 out of the 3 boxes were delivered. Again the driver told me it would be resolved as the missing box was the one with the tools and instructions to build.Again I had to try several times to contact somebody and when I got through they apologised and re-arranged delivery. The day came and went and nothing came. I rang back, they apologised again and arranged a new date. The day came and went and nothing came.On ringing this time, I was getting a little tired of having two boxes in my house unable to do anything with them and being given false promises with no compensation.The customer service person I spoke to informed me that the item was now fully out of stock, despite the website saying they had it in stock. He told me there was nothing I could do, I wasn’t entitled to compensation or a refund and I would just have to wait. When I told him this wasn’t acceptable his reply was “oh my god fam, you need to chill out”. To say I was wholly unimpressed with this disrespectful response is an understatement. I asked to speak to someone higher and he told me he could transfer me through but the managers never answered nor responded to complaints?!?When I mentioned that I would also be asking for a copy of the recording of the call which IKEA so kindly inform customers take place, his tone changed completely.However, two months later after the original booking I am still without the final box of the chest of drawers, out of pocket and without any form of compensation. Despite sending three formal complaint emails, I have heard nothing back from them.Shocking from beginning to end. I would 100% recommend to not use their service as I found it to be absolutely shambolic and disrespectful."

Doesn’t seem like you can book a time slot, you get told. After some difficulty finding their customer services number I finally got to speak with someone who assured me I had 3 days to collect it. Which was convenient for me as I was busy until the Friday.Went on Friday and after a rigmarole of phoning a number and keying in my order number ( they never make it easy) surprise surprise my rug had been put back into stock and there was no way I could collect. Apparantly according to the admittedly apologetic member of staff you only have 24 hours to collect. She told me that it was stated on my order, except it’s not.On the way back I had a text from ikea saying Thankyou for collecting your order! Of course there is no direct number to contact the store.No refund either have just checked my account. They must think I’ve collected. Just rang customer services, it cut off as recorded message says they’re busy. No rug, 32 mile round trip and taken £30 from me and I’ve had a lot of frustration.Shopped with dunhelm recently what a different and pleasant experience.Ikea just want you to shop then go away."

  "articleText": "I ordered a table from Ikea Bargain Corner Croydon on Gumtree. I was nervous about paying over the phone via their PCIPAL as I was worried incase the payment phone call might be scammers but the Customer Service Personnel - Gavin - was very understanding and patient and did everything necessary (including asking me to email & call main number whilst still on the phone with me) to reassure me that it was really Ikea.Collection was also a dream. They had well labelled separate parking space for Gumtree Customers and the collection was completed within 15minutes of us arriving there. Everything was done contactless as well.I have read some of the reviews on here about items ordered being out of stock after payment had been taken and I understand how frustrating that might be but I will urge that we remain a bit understanding with them in the face of the Covid situation.I will encourage you to check their Ikea Bargain Corner on Gumtree in your area as they only put items that are actually available up on there.The best bit for me was that the item I bought was £50 off the actual price simply because it was an ex display item."

So I waited several days until the shipment arrive to do what she told me to do. However the IKEA  delivery guy refused to do that, saying that he doesn't have a proof of return if we do it like that and he asked us to again call customer service to pick the product up. We had to call customer service again (another >30mins waiting) to make appointment to pick up. The customer service guy said the item will be picked up the next day, but it didn't happen. So we had to call again (another >30mins waiting) and the guy on the line said he would make sure this time the item will be picked up and he will call me the next day to check it it really happened or not. The next day no pick up, no call. Then we call customer for the third time (yes, again >30mins waiting). This time the customer service person said she has found the problem and FOR SURE the next day the item will be picked up. two days later and guess what? the item is still there. What should I do now???????!!!!!!!"

My latest drawer disappointment is with a Malm 6-drawer chest of drawers, where the metal support bar (part 123833) is fitted to the front of the drawer in a REALLY POOR way: it has no strength to prevent the back of the drawer from bowing outwards, and can easily jump off the screw which is supposed to hold it in place - at which point it drops down and jams the whole drawer shut.  Most of Ikea's designs work really well - how did this one find its way into a mainstream product?"

No notification of delay or apology. Whoever they were talking to assured them that the furniture was in transit but was just delayed and would be with them the following week. They got an email then the day it before it was supposed to arrive saying their order was cancelled and they would have to wait up to 14 days for a refund.The astonishing thing is that their customer service agents told me when I called on my parents behalf that just because you are able to purchase an item in IKEA website and even though money is taken out of your account, it doesn’t mean the item is in stock. I was dumbfounded when they said this.The customer services team lead I was talking to said that her team have requested a note to be put on the IE website warning customers that stock levels don’t match website and they still take money money from your account.Save yourself the hassle and disappointment of dealing with IKEA. Do not purchase anything online. Particularly from Ireland. The customer service team lead herself admitted that it’s an absolute mess at the moment. Expected better from IKEA."

I totally understood it. They delivered a week after the estimated delivery date, which was still acceptable for me. However, they delivered only table legs... The tabletop was missing. I called them right away, and they told me that they would deliver it as soon as they can at no delivery charge. I waited for another 2 weeks, and the status was still preparing. I called them again, and they just kept saying it was just being delayed due to the pandemic. The agent I spoke with told me that it was still in stock and there would be no problems. All I had to do was to be patient. Then, I got an email that they would have to cancel the order because it was out of stock. They no longer get the freakin phone calls and no response to my email. What should I do with the table legs without a tabletop? They charged me $45 for delivering the legs, and now they are asking me to return them at the store.

She did not mention though that if we made the order online we could have the entire sofa delivered to the new address and there was no need to pay twice for the delivery or trasfer the sofa ourselves. Apart from this fact, just 2 days before the delivery, they called us and they told us that most parts of the desk were out of stock even though they have been ordered (they claimed that it was a mistake and even when we ordered them they were out of stock). When we told them that we wanted also to cancel then the rest part (the two right legs of the desk), they told us that this is not possible and that we have to receive them and then return them to the store.

I contacted support and they said a new one would be shipped out. I get a shipping notification and call saying it would delivered today and it was not. My mom waited all day. I checked the tracking and it said the order was canceled yesterday. I did not get any notification about the ordering being canceled. I called Ikea and they said it was out of stock and that's why it was canceled and it was out of stock in the other colors. I was told that I could have an alternate which was incorrect information. It took almost an hour for the supervisor to get on the phone after I asked for her. She said I couldn't get an alternate and they only thing they could do was refund me. The dresser is still available on the website even though it was out of stock. I now have to go out and buy a dresser. It is so inconsiderate of the company to offer something that they cannot provide."

The phone lines are closed 'due to high demand', you cannot speak to anyone online, and they don't have an email address. So, don't buy anything you cannot afford to write off.I returned something worth £400 a month ago. No refund as yet, no contact from them, and I have literally no way of getting in touch. On the site they have a phone number but that doesn't work when you call it (and if you do get through it's an hour on hold), and their chat function is not always available, and when it is you get booted out of it 'by accident' so that you still cannot speak to anyone (again, minimum waiting time half an hour).Much as I used to like Ikea, they are now off the list and I will use other vendors."

Delivery option was an extra £40 for a delivery in 3 weeks time!So, I opted for the click and collect option - which still cost an extra £5. Why you should have to pay to collect from the store is beyond me.The nearest store is an hour away in London, but I needed it urgently so went for this option. I drove to the store only to be told there had been a mistake and the desk is out of stock.This would have been OK - mistakes happen, but I then explained I had driven to London to collect it and to save me going back empty handed could they find another store in London that I could collect from. The answer was basically no, we don't help customers, you have to phone \"Customer Services\". So I sat in the car park and phoned their customer service number. After 40 minutes of being on hold listening to Christmas music (on January 7th!) I gave up and hung up.I have been told I can have my money back in 4-5 days. Why 4-5 days? They took the money off me instantly, why can't they give it back instantly. So I now have the cost of a drive to London, a 40 minute phone call and half a day wasted and not even got my money back.I tried to phone again when I got home to complain, but the \"customer service\" number now says it is not operating at this time due to high demand. i.e. there must be a lot of unhappy customers out there."

If I am able to get the remaining table legs, I will pay for them. I will never purchase any other product from IKEA."

  "articleText": "Ikea policies and procedures are based on you visiting their store and making purchases you did not intend to make. So during a pandemic their inadequate on line order system risks your life. They won’t even allow you to buy a product in which you pay an outrageous shipping charge because it is labeled a first come first serve. They make it impossible for anything resembling a no contact pick up. They want money and do not care how many lives they risk. We have called, tried to order on line but always get a different story. This company should be ashamed and shut down during the pandemic!"

  "articleText": "March 2020- Ordered two bedside tables and paid 30 dollars shipping .May- one of them arrivedJune- other bedside was not delivered. I contact them. They ask me to contact fedex.FedEx has no record of item.I request a refund, the decide to sent me a replacement. Never arrives.Item is out of stock, I request a refund, refund never deposited.For months, they don’t answer their customer service line. (Due to “COVID”)Finally in December I am able to reach customer service again and request a replacement or refund. After half an hour with a representative, They issue a refund but declined to return my shipping cost...9 Months!! And all I have is 1 bedside table that does not match, therefore I will have to buy two new bedside tables. I lost $30 dollars of shipping for an item that never arrived. This was the worst costumer service I’ve ever encountered. Do not buy IKEA!"

  "articleText": "Terrible online ordering from Ikea Chicago. When the sofa I wanted finally became available (the system will not let you order if an item is not available)  I ordered with an estimated delivery date of 12/19/20. I received an automated call from the delivery company not long after confirming the the date. 12/19/20 came and there was no further communication about the delivery so I called. After a long hold time I got a customer service rep who told me only the frame was available. Why did the Ikea system let me order and tell me 12/19/20  if the unit I ordered was not actually going to be available?  Christmas was a bit awkward with no sofa for guests to sit on. Very disorganized company. Beware."

In Sept we got one but this was cancelled within a few hours and we could not reorder as no deliveries available. Money went back into  bank 3 days later. Eventially at beginning of Nov we secured a delivery for £600. The money was immediately taken from our account, delivery was not until 20th December but we planned around it. Our slot was between 12pm and 6pm, one item was a sofa so we removed our old sofa that morning. No delivery arrived although tracker said it had been delivered. I messaged ikea and still have not had any reply. I could not call as they had shut down phone lines. The following day I called and was on hold for 90 mins, then spoke to someone who told me there had been a landslide in Carlisle and order would be with me on next 48 hours, no ref no needed as company would text me directly. No delivery arrived we were left with no sofa from 20th right over Christmas. We live in Scotland so not sure why landslide in Carlisle affected delivery. I have been in touch with AA and they are unaware of any landslide in area at all.Now 27th a week with no sofa, or communication  from IKEA or any other part of my order. I rang again and eventually got through 1hr 10 mins after being on hold. The lady put me on hold while she spoke to required dept. She said for 1 min, 10 mins later I was hung up on. I awaited a call back as it could be an error, they have mobile and landline no. nobody called. I called again, on hold again, once connected I was again put on hold for yet another 15 mins to be told my order would be rescheduled for 10th January. By this time we will have been without sofa for 3 weeks. I asked for  issue to be escalated as not satisfied with delivery date, unhumane to be sitting on the floor. A manager was to call me back. That didn't happen!!! I have emailed complaints email address from 21st Dec and not even had recognition of email never mind a response. Certainly will not recommend ikea online orders/ deliveries and customer service is non existent.Certainly NOT …The Wonderful Everyday"

Ikea then insisted that they couldn't get the other half to me for over a month. Additionally, if I wanted a refund or to return the product I would have to transport the desk to an ikea store myself! How, as a student in London who doesn't drive am I meant to do that! I ended up spending over £30 on an Uber to Ikea to return the half of the desk so I could afford to buy another! The most I was offered as compensation was £20.The customer help line also takes at least 30mins and in some cases over an hour to get through to someone!I would not recommended that anyone order anything from Ikea as it is not reliable in the slightest and you could end up paying a very high price like I did!!"

I placed it in the beginning of November to insure the items were delivered to me well before the Christmas rush. I was given a date of 4th Dec. for delivery which was perfect. The order arrived but with 13 items missing. I called immediately and a very helpful lady assisted me and after listing out the missing items I was told these would be dispatched from the Dublin shop on the Monday as she  checked to insure they were in stock there. I waited a week but when nothing arrived I called again. Seems the order had never processed so I had to go through same thing all over again with another helpful lady and was told it would now arrive today 17 Dec. I took the day off work and waited but no delivery so I called to check and was told by another nice lady that unfortunately the order had NOT been processed. I saw red at that point. The options were that they could process it AGAIN but could not guarantee a delivery by Christmas. Some items were toys as gifts so this was not acceptable. At that point I had enough of IKEA and all this messing about so I asked for a refund for all the missing items only to be told this would take 10 to 14 days. I work in mail order and refunds only take 24 to 48 hours to show up in a customers account. They were very quick to charge my card for the full amount when the order was placed. At no point did I receive a notice that any of my order was out of stock and to see if I wanted a refund or to wait till they were available. There was no correspondence from the company once they had your money - it is the customer who has to keep trying to track down their order and sort out Ikea’s mistakes. This is not an acceptable way of doing business and I will never use them again and will warn others to be wary when placing an order."

  "articleText": "I ordered a DJUNGELSKOG Soft toy, brown bear as a Christmas gift early in November from the Ikea online store. I scheduled delivery for the first week in December, which was the earliest available.The order stated that I should receive notification of shipment a day or two before the scheduled delivery. When this didn't occur I called Ikea's customer support.The customer representative explained that the order didn't process correctly as it had been stuck in the system. She explained that she would re-order the item for delivery later in the week and assured me the gift would be with me in time for Christmas as the local store had almost 30 in stock.Two days later I was told the item had been cancelled and refunded as there was no stock available.It has now been 14 days since the product was cancelled and refunded and there's no sign of any refund in my account. I contacted the customer support line again, and they confirmed that the refund had not been processed and that they'll try to push it along.Next stop for me is a call to my bank for a chargeback."

  "articleText": "I placed an order of 3 items in October and was given a delivery date of 11/11 which is a long enough wait as it is, the day comes and no delivery nor an email or call to explain why. I contacted the customer service and was told my order will not be arriving until 4/12 which meant I placed my order in October and would have waited 2 months for it to arrive.The 4th comes and again no delivery I gave them the benefit of the doubt by allowing an extra day before I contact the customer service and again no delivery the 6th comes and I received two parts of my order (A shelf for the wardrobe I ordered) but no wardrobe which was the main part of my order.I contacted the customer service and was told the product I ordered was out of stock and this was the first I heard of this within the two months of which the order was placed, it also did not say out of stock on the website. The customer service employee had promised me I would get my order that coming Tuesday and to no surprise I did not get my product.I again called the customer service and was met with a rude and very helpless customer service team member who seemed they couldn’t care less about my situation and gave me no information about my order and wouldn’t refund me the product as I had “gotten some of the order”. This is not the first time I’ve shopped with IKEA but I can assure it will be the last as this has been the worst customer experience I’ve ever had with a company. P.S I am still left with no refund and very little information about what the next step will be. 1/10."

  "articleText": "We purchased a large EKET combination, costing just under £800. The plastic locking pins on one of the double cupboards side panels were all broken off when we opened the box. Another had a broken back panel. The door fittings are appalling and it is virtually impossible to get the doors fitted evenly around all 4 sides. It’s only due to the fact that I am an able DIY enthusiast that I could repair the damage and managed after 3 days work to complete the project. Ikea customer service were impossible to engage with and no where to be seen. In short, equivalent to the worst phase of MFI in the 1980s."

Woke up this morning to 3 emails telling me that my \"order has successfully been cancelled\" and a refund will be issued shortly. Called customer service and had to wait over an hour to speak with a rep. She was honest and told me that they oversold many products and have been cancelling many orders. On top of that she said that there is no way to know when anything will come back in stock. When I initially made the order I had to change it many times due to things that were listed as unavailable once I went to checkout, but didn't show as such on the product page. I was working off the information that if I was able to order it, it would actually be available. Disappointing to know this is not the case, and severely weakens my trust in ordering off the website, knowing there's a good chance it will get cancelled. I have been waiting for many of the items to complete a renovation, but will now be shopping elsewhere as I am on a deadline. This is obviously bad business and is not a way to retain customers..."

  "articleText": "We had a large return order of unopened items with all of our receipts. We also went on a 'slow day' where there was hardly a line.  We followed all the rules and the purchases were made less than a month from the return date. First of all, upon seeing the number of returns we had, every rep that glanced up suddenly had to pee to take a break. We finally ended up with a return customer service rep named Amanda who patiently helped us by going above and beyond to navigate a system that needs obscure information like a what register were you on and what day you bought this stuff. The Ikea computer system is really senseless and very hard to use  I'm still not sure why she had to \"find\" all the receipts when we had them anyways but that is beyond the point. The thing that really struck me was how poor her coworkers treated Amanda and the situation. Not a one coworker came to help and IN FACT a neighboring coworker kept telling her to stop helping us out because now the line was backing up.  She did this several times.  Did I not matter as a customer?  If things were taking too long for her, why did she not come over to help?  OR why didn't any of the people literally standing around behind the swinging doors come help? Was the $15,000 I did spend at IKEA not important for the rep to help us through some returns that were responsibly handled and organized by us.  Amanda thankfully ignored the selfish coworker and persevered. Amanda is a rare diamond of customer service skills in a generally large pool of apathetic, 'just here for the pay check and my manager is not watching' pool of employees found at IKEA.  I have had several poor customer service experiences at IKEA that have made me really resent going there."

So she spent 2 hours on the phone with Ikea and got a \"preliminary refund\" for the missing chairs.  My daughter knows her way around the Ikea system, because she went back on line and reordered those 4chairs  with her credit card and they arrived in 7 days.Now over a month later I don't have a refund. I've called dozens of times and all but one time got the message \"we are two busy to take your call\". The one young lady i did get not he phone said it takes at least 21 days but she did one of the two steps needed to move it along. That was 2 weeks ago.

It is worth to pay the 50-60 Euro shipping costs (for heavy stuff) than going there yourself. Customer support on the phone is decent and responsive (waited maybe 5 minutes maximum in the last 5 interactions I had to make). IKEA stands behind their warranty and replaced our Friheten sofa for free after 5 years with a brand new one. So although the product doesn't last as long as you'd expect, the warranty does.Due to COVID-19, It is unbelievably crazy how long are the lines. Don't go there, don't waste your life, better to order online and pay delivery. If you do decide to go, make sure to wait for COVID-19 to end. Then if you don't have a car use GoCar or Yuko.Generally, I don't like spending hours there. The Wifi is rubbish, can't really login. Cafeteria is dirty, and though there are vegan options they seem to be not great at all. Go there quickly focused on what you need for your home."

  "articleText": "We recently purchased a wall mounted extractor hood for our cooker from IKEA.Unfortunately there was no indication in the product details that the \"chimney\" part was not compatible with ceilings that have a coving.We therefore need to return the the extractor hood. However, while the website says the IKEA returns policy is upto 365 days except for certain items, it is necessary to find a person in order to arrange this.IKEA provides two numbers for customer service  and after sales. Neither number usually works and simply provides a message that this number is not available and when it is the wait is interminable with possibly the worst on-hold music I have ever heard.Most of the time you are directed to the IKEA Chatbot LATTJO. This does not help much and tends to take the harassed customer around in circles and usually back to the returns policy page.It might be preferable to return the goods to the nearest collect and service centre, but that is shut.IKEA may have some very nice products, but make sure you make a perfect choice and ensure you have checked all the dimensions provided. Make any sort of mistake and you are likely to have serious difficulty in sending to goods back for refund.As often happens this review is written while listening to execrable on-hold music on the phone which is really an insult to the intelligence. It was 62 minutes into the call when a service person picked up the phone. He was very helpful but suffering from computer malfunctions which meant that he could not complete the return but would have to send me an email with the return details.Very poor service even if the better stuff is value for money. probably not worth buying unless you live close to a store.The pandemic is given as excuse but this is no excuse really especially for on-line customers. With at least another 6 months of risk for shoppers regardless of vaccines being available, one would of thought IKEA might have taken on more people to answer the phone. If Amazon can manage it so could IKEA. I cannot help wondering how many customers will have given up waiting.This was on the evening of 07th December 2020."

They told me I had to pick it up that day in the email. I can’t. I tried to contact ikea in every way possible about picking it up next weekend.  The only way I got to talk to someone only spoke Chinese. I tried to contact via email and it told me the only option to contact them about was order cancellation. This is stupid."

I'm a Nurse, and have worked throughout this pandemic doing long hours, so I value my time off. I have now wasted an entire Saturday waiting for a SCHEDULED delivery, which I booked ages ago, that never showed.

Have spent nearly six hours on the phone in total trying to get it sorted. Have now been given five different delivery dates only one of which happened where I got half my order. No notice of no deliveries given. Have now taken four holidays from work for deliveries, total waste of time. My last call to them was 1 hour 26 mins just for them to pick up the phone and immediately put it down. When I did get to speak to an adviser I asked if she could phone me back if we get cut off, if I could speak to a supervisor, if I could get an email address as calls were taking too long,  I was given a flat no to all of my requests.  Even the delivery guys on the one occasion they did show up said \"this is what Ikea do\".  With that total lack of customer service I'm amazed they're still trading.  Gave up trying to phone. Think I'll have to end up going legal."

However, they cannot deliver before approx 3 weeks from that date, and I need the thing that weekend.2. OK, no problem, I will go to the store and pick it up. I don't have a car, but I'll manage somehow. I get to the store at 20:40 (store closes at 21). I find the carpet eventually, but it says to contact an employee and present them with a product number. But there are almost no employees around. When I find one, he tells me I need to find someone else with a computer. I wander aimlessly unable to find anyone anywhere near a computer until 21:00 and its time to vacate the shop and take the bus all the way back home.3. The next day, I go online again, and this time I choose delivery to a pick-up point for Thursday evening.4. Thursday, I go to the pick up point... and guess what product they don't have in the van? That's right, my carpet.5. Another driver calls me later from a different part of town asking me why I am not there. I inform him they delivered to the wrong place, and he says customer service will call me tomorrow.6. It should be no surprise at this stage that they never called, and I didn't get the carpet by the weekend. Instead, I am calling them now, only to find more than 1 hour waiting time. This review is being written to the sound of elevator music playing on my phone."

No refund on the £40 delivery fee told him I have no bed he ask if I had a sofa to sleep on?The customer services is shocking so bad I told him to just cancel the £740 order and I will go elsewhere the shop is a joke.Probably the worse shop to order off so if you buy something don’t expect this year or the next year..."

  "articleText": "Ordered items online for collection from Gateshead.  Received email on 24 Nov to state order ready for collection between 8am - 8pm that day!  Unable to collect that day so tried to contact them on 2 different numbers off the internet.  One number didn't exist and the other number on the website given for complaints had a recorded answerphone message stating \"Due to high demand this service is not available\"!  Drove to Gateshead today only to be told that because we didn't collect on 24th the order has been cancelled and I need to re-order.  I asked when my money will be refunded and was told I will receive an email notifying us of this and when the money will be refunded into my account.  I asked why I didn't receive an email stating that the order had been cancelled as this would have saved me making a wasted journey of 40 miles each way!  Her only response was \"...due to covid etc....\" I'm afraid this is not a valid reason I have ordered from other online businesses during the first and second lockdown with no problems whatsoever.  I am now trying to find an email to complain to but can't find one.  I want to know when I'm getting my money back.  I will definitely not be ordering from IKEA again.  ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING CUSTOMER SERVICE !!"

In short what happened after: i went to ikea to check the matress, i talked on the phone and the person said is better to order in the shop, i went back to the shop, they made the order and the customer service was supposed to fix the exchange, i went to customer service and they said i will be called because they can't fix it as the system is not working, I was never called back and I called and I was told that I have to reply to the email because by phone they don't know how to manage it and don't have access to the reference number. For the past week I've been sending emails everyday and no one responded even though it says 24 hours response rate. The clock is ticking in having the exchange for my mattress, I'm not sleeping well on the one I have (as mentioned in the history at the reference number). Is there anyone in this company that can do something about it and fix this situation?"

I mistakenly thought things were looking up after two ring tones I heard another robot which mechanically told me \"the customer service was closed.\"Pass this reveiw on and tell your friends and colleagues to avoid IKEA as they will just take your money and ignore you"

  "articleText": "YESTERDAY I RECEIVED REPLACEMENT PART..... its clear from my experience & all the bad reviews I've read on here that IKEA need to seriously address their customer. Service issue & be more available.  Not everyone lives near a store.  Part numbers aren't all listed on the instructions either so this is another issue which could have made my problem. Easy.  I see ikea doesn't even comment on this site... They need to really listen to their customers, esp. As there is so much competition now with online shopping, similar products, often cheaper with much cheaper or free delivery..... This is only good business sense!!!I bought a Hemnes 8 drawer unit from IKEA online, delivered in good time but one split in a panel.  I messaged them as there's no other way to get HolD of ikea but got an automated reply.  The unit is useless without a replacement panel.  It's has a rob ot on customer service which says they can replace a part if you give a part no. But there is no number on. Either the part or the instructions. £215 and I have a pile of wood put together apart from the faulty part so I can't use it & have my clothes in plastic bags.  Jaques Alston"

  "articleText": "I ordered 3 products.  One was fine and had all the appropriate hardware.  the second item a Lilligan high cabinet was 1) missing some brackets and some wooden dowels.  My son had some extra dowels from some furniture he had bought so we put the thing about 3/4's together when I realized the legs were missing.  I called and called and called - 6x waited on customer service hold for 30+ minutes before finally hanging up.  Emailed and no help.  Finally, we got in the car and drove 35 minutes one way to the store.  they said the feet were not included even though the picture when ordering same shows them.  So I bought - for another $21 - the feet.   Drove 35 minutes back home and found (1) 1 leg was missing the hole to attach the footer (2) the feet were not correct for my cabinet.  I called Visa and contested it as I am NOT doing an hour and 10 minute drive again.  I will NEVER buy or recommend IKEA again.  Horrid customer service - in fact  saying they have customer service is laughable.  the 3rd product was a cutlery insert - size was over what it said and I returned it since I was in the store for the \"feet.\""

When they arrived I’ve opened all the noses to start putting them together and I’ve noticed bits in every box are missing. 2 hours on the phone and finally got a delivery date for them and yet again it another 2 weeks off before they can be delivered.

I asked for them to refund the delivery as it’s now going to be 5 weeks before I’ve actually got all of My order. Apparently they can’t do that either."

  "articleText": "My kitchen was installed a little over 2 years ago by Ikea. A leak has sprung from the dishwasher pipe, dripping on to the socket, This has been causing a short circuit, taking out all kitchen appliances, as well as CH. I contacted Ikea and was asked to send a photo, which I did.  In the most obvious brush off, they replied that leak \"appeared to be\" coming from the house drain, and that I should arrange for repairs myself, as a matter of urgency, Now I am not a professional photographer, and cannot capture a drip in motion. I can, however, see it and touch it. It is coming from the pipe to the dishwasher installed by Ikea. This I have told them, twice, one week ago, only to  be met by silence, So much for urgency!I paid hugely more to have Ikea install the kitchen, rather than a third party.  This was for the peace of mind offered by a 10 year warranty covering appliances and installation. Was this an expensive, empty promise?It is worth noting that I am in Scotland, where Ikea stores remain open and customer services, at least in theory, are still working."

To try to solve my issue I have been in store because on the phone they lie, they don’t do absolute nothing, just say they do.

  "articleText": "I have placed two orders with IKEA during the pandemic. The delivery we received last month arrived on the day as agreed and I received regular updates on the day too. Delivery drivers were very professional and quick (bringing in 10 very heavy boxes) and items were as described.The second order again went through smoothly. Unfortunately I missed the delivery (my own fault!). I contacted customer services, after listening to ABBA for 20 minutes my call was answered by Jade who said she had rearranged the delivery for me. However this weekend when the delivery arrived we were missing nearly half our items. I tried to track this with the option on the website only to be told my original order had been cancelled and a new one placed without all the items! (Items are all still in stock). What's worse is I haven't even been refunded for the items either. Now I'm having to call IKEA again with a wait time of over an hour this weekend. What an absolute waste of time."

So I called them AGAIN, explained everything and a lady asked to hold on that she was going to check something and guess what HUNG UP the phone... I called AGAIN and explained everything AGAIN, and the guy said that someone is going to my house to collect the underframe and only after this collection they will do the refund (which I have to wait 7 to 14 days), which is not fair, I already did the request 4 days BEFORE, now they want to wait 1 week more to get my money back! UNBELIEVABLE! and thennnnn when I was telling that is not fair this guy HUNG UP THE PHONE on my face!!!Emma and Daniel from the customer service hung up the phone on my face!"

First i was misled about timing of delivery of missing stock. Then i received absolutely no help considering that the kitchen is left half finished. Product great. Price great. After sales help useless. Chat line a waste of time. Phoning is a joke. So now i will be going to store and they will be  getting the base cabinet delivered from halifax or i will be causing them a big problem. No one is going to mislead me. Then give me a line of bull while i wait wjth no kitchen  if you order a kitchen do not accept anything unless all the cabinets are supplied.

You can't add multiple of one item to your cart, you have to do that in the cart, after. You can't order any item for click and collect at your local store, if there are no spaces available that day - GOD forbid you want to look at availability of upcoming days–like you are able to with any other business that moved quickly to add curb-side pick up options during a time of COVID...even companies that are a fraction of the size and resources of IKEA can get it right - guess what? YOU CAN'T! You have to go back to the site EVERY DAY, like a lottery and wish and hope you are able to find available spot - only THEN can you complete your order - but it's all secret, like they don't want to tell you that they can only work one day at a time, with no view into a calendar of upcoming days.Then if you are lucky enough to be able to complete your order, if any of the items in your cart are not available for click and collect OR delivery, they DELETE them from your cart - nope, they don't save it for future, give you the option to move it to a shopping list, so you can add them back in - they are just gone.Availability - Yes it's in stock: but no, you can't purchase it. Inventory shows in stock (over 35 items), but when you try and check out, it says they are not available, when clearly, even after checking their phone line, with the item number, they are in fact very much in stock.If their click and collect spaces are limited, why not have a message on the site, for customers to manage their expectations? Why not show more than 1 or 2 days availability for spaces available? Why not provide a message to your customers that are clearly having a terrible experience with your site? Why are you not looking to do things that will bring your customers back to you when this is all over.I realize this is a *RANT*. I have been a customer for 3 decades and this experience makes me want to never shop there again."

Customer service USED to be reliable.Fast forward to 3 years of not shopping at IKEA and so much has changed - for the WORST. Like most people during the pandemic, I needed a desk and chair to work from home. Nothing expensive, just something to get me through the next few months. I bought a LINNMON desk (under 30 dollars), and a LOBERGET/BLYSKÄR swivel chair (under 30). I actually visited the store to see the products and they were just not great but okay for the price, but good enough for the purpose of short-term telecommuting. Or so I thought.I couldn't purchase the products in store, as they're basically out of everything during the pandemic, so I kept an eye on their stock, ordered the products online for in-person pick up (the website is a laggy and unintuitive MESS).One item in my order was confirmed, the second (table) never was, even on the scheduled pick up day.I drove an hour, again, to the store, had to chase staff down to find out why one order was still \"processing,\" got that sorted, then had drive to the garage to do a \"click and collect\" (which went easily enough). Got my items home, seemed simple enough to put together, at first sight.However, when I went to put the table together, which comes in several parts (including the metal base the legs screw into), I had to struggle to try to get the screws in, because the cheap table top holes are so shallow and barely there, compared to the size of the screws (and no tools were provided), that I developed 3 blisters on the palm of my hand and *still* wasn't able to get the screws into the table! It's the cheapest, worst product in the history of my lifetime, and I've bought a lot of furniture in my adult life!No luck trying to contact customer service. They haven't been answering their phones since July 2020! So, guess what? I'm returning both pieces, another hour's drive and an hour wait time to queue for the \"Return\" department, and I'm never shopping at IKEA again.I used to love IKEA but, like everyone else who sold out to C h i n a - where the flimsy and cheap table and chair are made, quality is definitely not what one would call this junk. Plus, their site doesn't even allow reviews - at least, not that I've found a way to do so, and I've looked! - so *buyer beware* and make sure to read the lowest ratings on their site, as those are the actual real reviews!AVOID at ALL costs!"

I'm in a COVID medium area and so people are able to come into my house if it's work-related and they're wearing a mask.The delivery drivers turned up (no masks) and left the wardrobes blocking my hallway. When I asked them to take them to the right room they said that due to COVID it wasn't possible as all the windows need to be opened before they arrive. IKEA did not mention this in any communications!But can you get hold of IKEA to discuss? - after a 46-minute wait on the phone (IKEA provides no email contact) I got hold of someone who said the compliant had to go to someone else.So if IKEA really can't deliver to a room or my choice due to COVID they should not charge the £50 delivery charge for the service! Fake advertising, taking my money under a false pretense!"

  "articleText": "As a many times returning customer to Ikea I am simply speechless and lost for words as to the unbelievably bad experience I had in delivering my large wardrobe order (including installation service). Their delivery folks practically refused to deliver the order! The truck driver said there are too many children playing in the adjacent park for them to park the truck in the designated loading zone and offload the goods! After contacting their customer service and requesting an explanation \"IKEA\" said it is the drivers call to make.  BTW IKEA had delivered another wardrobe exactly the same size for a different room in my apartment a year prior. So I don't understand!  Their customer support manager called me back to basically say they will make another booking for another time but couldn't tell me when nor could he guarantee delivery. Great customer service! Well done IKEA. I guess they have become just like every other giant corporation who forget who keeps their lights on. Shame on you IKEA... I would suggest not to take your customers for granted."

Therefore you cannot buy the couch, and some of them wanted me to buy the half parts and wait for the second missing parts, come back and purchase the rest of the missing parts and pay another delivery.  Until, one guy, yes one guy from customer service name Alex, put an afford to schedule the parts available at Rhodes to be delivered, and open a case for the rest of missing parts and are available at Tempe. To be delivered and with no charge of delivery.I am shocked for experiencing such poor customer service from 4 people and only the 5th one was the kind man and genuine whom helped with everything.Alex, is an excellent asset to IKEA. he was very passionate despite my frustration from previous members from couch dep section and customer service. Alex treated me very nice and kind.He was agreed with me on all of the levels of the frustration.Such a genuine personality and kind.I hope IKEA keeps and increase individuals as Alex and decrease unprofessional individuals.Thank you very much AlexBest of luck and wishes.RegardsSANorth Sydney"

  "articleTitle": "The worst experience",
  "articleText": "This Ikea order and delivery has been one of the worst experiences of my life.Firstly, the order came damaged and we had to send it back and re-ordered it all again (63 packages - €4000). Secondly, some of the items that we first ordered, were not in stock anymore, and we had to chase them when they were back in stock, go and buy it ourselves as Ikea couldn't deliver them later (as it would have been normal because it was their mistake in the first place. We ordered the items when there were in stock). Then we had to chase for the refunds for weeks and call and stay on hold on the phone for hours.Thirdly, we designed a wordrobe in the Ikea Dublin store, and the guys there forgot to put all the items from the store design in the actual order and bill. We realised when we wanted to build the wordrobe that some shelfs were missing, and that we never paid for them as they were not put in the bill (just the design). Lastly, when the final order came, there were 63 packages - 459kg in total. I had to carry them all myself and another friend (some packages had 50kg and I have 50kg). I understand the covid rules, but it's insane that they didn't even bring them in front of the apart. door. What was I supposed to do? Make 5 orders and pay the delivery fee every time just so we could cary the 50kg items 4 floors?On top of all of these, the delivery guys delivered us 2 - 50kg packages that were not ours. We had to carry them all the way up, and then chase for the collect team to come one week after.The most horrible experience overall, and Ikea was not helpful at all even if we had a very large order. The contact support centre was ok, the people were nice, but for nothing if the delivery guys and people in the deposit messed up and damaged our delivery and then the wordrobe designer didn't export all the items in the actual order and bill...."

The online system made it appear that the rest being prepared or on its way. After a month, nothing else has been delivered with NO change to the online order status (still appears as either in transit or being prepared).The support line won't connect calls to an agent. The online site only allows emails for cancellations. I tried the cancellation route to simply get a message to them. After 2 more weeks I got a reply from 3rd party support company. They asked for the very same information that was already in the reply email (order number and my request). I replied politely giving again the order number and request. No reply.This is not a covid issue. IKEA seems to have a broken system for successfully processing orders and definitely is broken as it relates to providing customer service.I have now disputed via credit card company. This is a shame. I thought that a modern company like IKEA would have their act together. They do not.My suggestion: Do not do ecommerce orders with IKEA."

I said i didnt feel this was addequate , he said thats the policy and there is nothing else he could do.I asked to speak to someone else he refused to put me through to anyone as this was also the polcy.One star may be one too many for this on customer service.Update.A week later.Covers arrived today via courier but sofas didn’t, contacted Ikea and they said they had changed the sofa delivery to two days later and if I had logged in I could have found this out myself. Silly me !!!.Oh and the £20 voucher hasn’t arrived.Update:Lorry arrived, delivery driver said you may want to check this before I unload it as it looks damaged. Went on the lorry and they had brought the same Broken one back ... couldn’t believe it.Need something to sit on so talked to customer service who said I could have it and they will send another when it comes back on stock.This time a promised £30 voucher. Been weeks and still haven’t got the first one.Wonder how many more calls it’s going to take..........well after the promised call waited a month and nothing so back to the phone.. on hold an hour and ten before answering, gave my reference number was told I’d be put on hold whole she looked it up... 20 minutes on hold and cut off. Called back under an hour this time and the chap said would I accept £60 and keep the broken one, said ok but still waiting for the other promised money, he said he would call me back. I doubt if I’ll ever get any money or a call. I have learned my lesson, do not buy from these people again. They really don’t care."

  "articleTitle": "Shockingly poor customer service at Ikea at the moment",
  "articleText": "My friend Anna and I made an online Ikea order in September and was initially given a delivery date before the end of that month. At the last minute the date was put back to 1st October which was acceptable. We had of course paid for our items in full as normal (just under £110) and we had received a confirmation email of the payment and order, followed by a message confirming our order was complete and all was running to plan. Then nothing?! When we attempted to track our order the file simply says 'our order is being prepared' even though we had already been told everything had been compiled?! We can't seem to cancel the order or request a refund, we can't seem to reach anyone on the phone despite several attempts and the online chat link through the 'customer service' section of the website we found was extremely basic and very unhelpful.  We are feeling very angry that on October 15th we are still waiting for our delivery and can get no further information about the delays or any idea about when we can expect to receive our purchases. We have been extremely patient and this experience has now deeply scarred our trust in Ikea. As online shopping is likely to be the main way in which purchases are made during the pandemic this will directly affect any decision we make about future shopping with Ikea. We are seeking a swift resolution to this shoddy and inconsiderate service if Ikea cares about customer experience at all.Update October 22nd - still no word at all from Ikea. Clearly they dont think customers matter at all - just in love with money, money, money!Taking my stars down to zero really but one is the lowest o  the Trustpilot scale - not happy at all!"

They didn't know why the kitchen wasn't delivered but informed us that in any case, most items are out of stock in Montreal. We reminded them that the kitchen installer was coming in 7 days and we were facing $$ penalties if he wasn't able to do his job. They committed to find some stocks at boucherville. They told us that our issue would be raised as a top priority and someone from Boucherville will call us back the following day to schedule a delivery before end of week.NO ONE CALL US BACK THE FOLLOWING DAYWe called Ikea customer service back. One hour wait. They said they were not able to reschedule a delivery as the systems was saying the delivery already occured! They said that our file was \"being processed\" and there is nothing they can do to ensure a delivery before the installation date and most items are out of stock in Montreal.That's the kind of service you would get from Ikea.1. You won't get your kitchen delivered,2. Tou won't recover your deposit from your Kitchen installer3.

  "articleText": "The delivery guy straight up lied about \"trying\" to contact us besides phoning us according to the explanation of the customer service. I admit, it is my fault that I had bad phone signal while they tried to call me. But the guy also called me before the \"vereinbarte Lieferzeitraum\".Then I called the IKEA delivery guy, and he said things like: nicht mein Job, ich bin Beschaeftigt, rufen Sie die Kundenservice an. Lieferung jetzt? Nein! In ein Monat. Ich habe keine Zeit zum Liefern. Wir waren da. Auf wiedersehen! Lieferung nicht möglich. Wir sind beschäftigt. Ich gebe Ihnen meine Kollege (then he put the phone aside, not even listening).His German was just as broken as indicated by the 7-13 delivery feedback, then he hang up on me. I gave him a second chance to explain himself why he didn't ring the Intercom and why he didn't just go to the Reception of the building. There was a person sitting right at the entrance, whose job includes welcoming delivery staff, so at least he could have tried. DHL found us. Even DPD found us. Anyone on a 7-10EUR budget found us. IKEA on a 100EUR spedition budget couldn't find us.The Intercom instructions were in the address. We were all the time at home and no-one rang. I asked the receptioninst if anyone came during the indicated time, and no-one had been there.Yet, once I called the customer service, he saw a record that they had tried to reach me, they tried to ring, they even came in the building and didn't find my \"Briefkasten\" (hint: it's there, and before finding my Briefkasten, the Receptionist would have surely asked them if she could help).Therefore, I asked myself, why didn't the receptionist see anything and despite obvious Intercom numbers, why didn't we hear anything in the apartment? Either the spedition lied, or we are both deaf (hint: I can hear quite well) and the receptionist is blind (hint: she saw me quite well once I spoke to her). I also tested both the intercom and the doorbell. They worked. So then, the only conclusion I can find is that some lazy people want to avoid work by blaming failed delivery on some excuse. However, based on the above proof, the blame failed.In exchange for paying 100EUR delivery costs, I expect a higher quality of service. Obviously, I asked for a full refund including the spedition costs. To make sure it happens on time, I informed my credit card company requesting a chargeback having explained the situation.Furthermore, while speaking to customer service, I reported the delivery staff for the horrible service.In the unlikely case the 100% refund is disputed, I will continue voicing my opinion elsewhere, there are great forums."

The adviser looked at my receipt, took all my details inc. telephone number and has advised me to \"leave it with him\" and also advised me that the refund will be processed within next 3 days.It has been 10 days now and I have not received any money, there was no contact from IKEA either...I really do not know what to do now.

They keep picking with us with quality,  so that we cannot grow.   The calls come in every 4 seconds, we have no voice or support and quality should ALWAYS  be out-sourced, with people that have never worked onsite. Not a big ugly gorilla, that worked right in the building with all of us.  So they work hand and hand with managers that want to pick with us, by giving bad scores.  Please do an Audit as soon as possible and you can see what we mean.I know managers that are no longer with the company and have shared that they get people to call in to do prank calls, just to mess with certain people, so that they get bad scores.  We think you should send a decoy to see what's going on.   Also,  we want Quality to be people who have Never seen us and don't know Any of the Management.Please understand, we are tired of having are jobs tested and toyed with.  If you send someone in to look at the stats, you will see the people they keep messing with.  It is so sad to work for a company that allows Management and quality to play with the co-workers livelihood.We also have not received ANY hazard pay for using our electricity and internet at home.  We are going to speak to a News Station, Government Official and a Union Rep, because we are tired of being treated like crap!Please help us, we really need you.IKEA CSC Gen4 Co-workers*THIS IS DISGUSTING*I'm not spending another cent with that Cheap Ass company!!!"

  "articleText": "We placed two in-store kitchen appliances (gas stove and refrigerator) for my elderly parents. Please note we would NOT have purchased it from Ikea if there's no delivery to the room of our choice due to these being heavy kitchen appliances, we would have gone elsewhere.In-store home delivery department associate Julia D as listed specifically told me \"these will be delivered to whichever room you would like.\" I have also found the below screenshot from the Ikea website and highlighted in yellow on which items can be delivered to your room of choice due to COVID time.Delivery guys were extremely rude from the way they spoke and their actions. And neither one wore any face mask on or any PPE when approaching. My parents even provided PPE from face masks to shoe covers for them, they kept saying it's COVID (but not wearing PPE, that's very ironic).The delivery guys also dropped the refrigerator on purpose out of spite after my parents told them they will be calling to complain. Not being able to get these inside, we have no way of testing if these are in good condition and workable.The incident today really caused a massive amount of frustrations for my parents due to what they had to deal with today and now leaving two items currently sitting in the garage. Also, we felt that we have been lied to by the associate given out false information. This has by far the WORST customer service we have experienced, what if my parents didn't have a garage and it's currently raining season in Florida, are these heavy items supposed to be sitting out. These items are still sitting at the garage because no one can lift or move them, it's not really a garage decor.We need a solution on this issue ASAP as this is absolutely ridiculous: from being misinformed in store, getting unnecessary rudeness from the delivery people to unreachable customer service. Please think of the type of frustration my parents and I are going through after spending so much $$$ at IKEA, a place where we thought had the best products and service."

Their email “option” is only to cancel an order, they don’t even give you the opportunity to inquire about it. If you try to call a local store, it reroutes you back to the main number where again, no human! So fine, since you’ve already got my money once, I will not speak to someone set up in a department designed to only take more money, when you obviously don’t care about those you’ve already taken from.

  "articleText": "IKEA after sale service is terrible. I spent over 8 hours on the phone for a single online order which I paid for, never received, and that \"wasn't in their system\". I had to fight with them and give several proofs that I paid for the purchase. After 4 2-hours phone calls with them, they finally \"found\" the order with the local store that was supposed to deliver and I finally got my refund.That specific order was over $200 worth of legs for the office. Before that, I bought a few tabletops that I'm now trying to return (they've been delivered and I never touched them since) and once again it's a big hassle to do. I'm currently in that process and just now I just spent 2 hours on the phone with them: 1h20 of waiting time, then 5 min of discussion, then waiting, then 1 min to tell me they'll call me back !?It's insane. I never experienced such a bad customer service from a big company like this.Unacceptable. On sure thing is that they'll never get my money again!"

I was interested only because I'm now stuck with an Ektorp sofa, chair, and footstool with no options for slipcovers. Ikea discontinued the series with no notice so for all of us that bought Ektorp this year, we seem to be out of luck. My friend ordered items in June which IKEA then cancelled on the delivery day in September and still have not refunded her money. They have no idea what they are doing anymore in Canada.

  "articleText": "I ordered a new kitchen at Ikea in april, I wish I had bought it somewhere else!Already at delivery there were several issues; the new dishwasher was damaged on one side, wrong fridge door, the kitchen worktop was missing, wrong hinges for several doors, the side panel has been delivered at a wrong address.The person where this panel was delivered contacted me, however the panel is too big to transport without a van.  Still, this person was so kind to bring this panel to my house with his trailer (thank you!).On top of that, today I tried to contact customer service, waited 1hr09mins on the phone in vain, a second time again 45mins and last time 59mins in vain!!And of course all these phone costs are on you!Finally managed to speak to someone, they promised to call me back, till today not a single Ikea-ring on my phone.They were going to deliver the missing worktop this Saturday, I waited at home and saw…nobody!  Again  on hold at customer service without ever speaking to someone, just one automated mail, “Unfortunately, something went wrong. We are sorry…..”The guarantee on the kitchen appliances start from order date, this was 6 months ago and I cannot even install my kitchen!  It is a disgrace.You would think that if they make mistakes, they would do everything possible to solve them and limit the damage instead of creating extra frustrations.And get this…they blame all of it on the Corona-crisis.  Lame and easy excuse.And I'm posting this on as many review sites as I can, becouse,One advice for you all, if you want to cook a meal in the next 12 months, never ever order a kitchen from Ikea"

She rescheduled me another dresser to ship and coordinated a September 5th delivery. September 5 came and went, still no dresser.

  "articleText": "IKEA’s online and phone customer service is the worst of any company I have ever had dealings with. If I could give only 1/2 star, I would! The first order I placed took over a month to deliver. Checking out was near impossible since I needed to ship to an order different than my billing address, their system would not allow it. I had to first buy a gift card, which took over a week to be emailed to me, and then use it instead of my credit card. Later, I tried placing a second order. (Big mistake!) When it needed to be cancelled, it took 2 phone calls, both of which I was on hold for over 45 minutes before anyone answered. Then, it took one month and 2 more hour long phone calls to get the refund for the canceled order. After the first phone call, I immediately received an email confirming the cancellation. But, weeks later I realized the customer service agent never processed the refund. When I tried to reorder, IKEA would not let me check out until I removed several items they decided were “limited quantity”. It is unfortunate that their online/website and customer service is so poor, because they have awesome products at fantastic prices - in their stores."

Not to mention emails that go unanswered... Finally I called the American Express and told them what happened and emailed them the photo of the return order that the delivery guy signed as a proof of a return and the American Express refunded the money right away. I placed an order of a plastic table and two plastic chairs for kids on Sept. 11 and it gave me an estimate delivery date Sept. 27 Today is Sept 29 and no delivery update.

  "articleText": "Terrible experience with Ikea.I ordered a desk, bin, shelves and a jar on June 30th for a 19th August delivery date (it was the earliest they offered) - a slot that I paid for. It never showed up and the tracking didn't change from the day of dispatch.I tried to contact customer service via phone 3 times only to be thrown off the queue after 35+ minutes of waiting. I sent numerous emails, Twitter messages, tweets and Facebook messages with no response.When I finally got though on the phone, I was told that the desk was out of stock but the other items could still be delivered to me. I said no, I want the whole order cancelled and refunded.1. Why wasn't I contacted? I had booked a time slot on the 19th August and had no contact whatsoever from Ikea to say that the item wasn't available.2. Why weren't my other items delivered to me on the 19th August?Customer service worker was nice about it, she apologised. She had no explanation for why I wasn't contacted as there wasn't one - it's just neglectful. If a small business took a customers money and didn't deliver the products with no contact whatsoever they would be ruined, this isn't acceptable.They knew it was out of stock on the 30th June, they had just under an entire month to tell me this and didn't. And just to add to it, I had booked the day off work to receive this delivery so lost a days holiday for nothing."

  "articleText": "They try hard but fall very short...I bought something online in April, which got delivered damaged. They couldn't collect it for months due to COVID-19 restrictions but it took them another 2 months to arrange the pick up of the return and they weren't responding to emails (they got in touch with me first) and every person over the phone couldn't really help, as they were fairly clueless.5 months later, they've collected the item but issued me a GIFT CARD instead of my cash. I never asked them for a gift card, nor did they offer. It's taking me 2 weeks to get my actual money back, in fact, I'm on hold with hem now..This has been the MOST frustrating dealing with an issue in my life. Their customer support is beyond useless and they're not equipped for the customer support expectations of a 21st-century customer."

We were finally at check out and we had stuff our stuff on the till when the Basket I was going to get was going to be scanned there was no price tag so anxiety spiked again the person who was checking us out ask us where we got it I said where got it which was the as is section she told us we had to go back there and get them to price it my sister Knowing I have anxiety and being a cashier ask if she can call because that part of the job the cashier said no I can’t the customer has to go talk to them so my sister grab the basket and went to as is section waited at the door I definitely didn’t wanna go back to. My sister waited for 7 minutes no one showed up to help so she called me my dad told the cashier and the cashier said she has in as is section and we kept telling her she was and no ones there after about to minute the cashier made a call finally saying you someone there needing a price check, they finally went and helped my sister, they told my sister this is not from the as is section my sister got from over there pointing to where I found it they kept saying it’s not from here it’s a new item but they will price check it for us so they checked it it was 22 dollars I was having so much anxiety I said no to getting so I can leave faster and for how rude the staff was. My sister when coming back saw the worker she was talking to put the basket in the as is section where I found it. What I have to say is I don’t get why people where mean when we’re asking politely like I get you might be having a bad day but please don’t be taking out on others because you don’t know  what there going through either."

The e-mail gave no tracking number.Today is Sept. 25. After wasting an hour trying to track the order through Fed Ex and the IKEA website, I called their customer service.  I had to call three times before I was put in the queue.  I asked the CSR for a tracking number so I could track it myself on the Fed. Ex. website.  He informed me that the order was still in the warehouse and had not actually been shipped and may take another week before it's placed on the Fed. Ex. truck.  Very frustrated at this point and will not shop online there again.  My fingers are crossed that I get the order soon."

Which they gave me.Eventually the wardrobe came back into stock, but hey guess what?, The gift card won't work.I spent 3 weeks in emails, incl about 5 hours in waiting time for calls to be connected...I'm STILL waiting for them to fix the gift card problem to this day, and also expecting a delivery on the 28th of September, but reading other comments here....I'm doubtful.I thought Ikea Dublin was great,but I'm so very wrong."

  "articleTitle": "1.5 months out atm and nothing has been delivered",
  "articleText": "I first tried to place an order about 5 months ago and the computer program wasn't working properly, with availability varying from moment to moment, and so I called customer service directly. After 30+ minute I finally got through and spent the next hour with the rep who kept thinking they could get the items I requested, but every single attempt failed, and so in the end they recommended I try again in 2 weeks, which I kept on doing over the course of ~2 months.Finally, the items showed as available for delivery, and so I place the $1,700 order and scheduled the earliest delivery date that was 12 days out. I was informed that the delivery company would contact me and provide updates on the status of the delivery, which they did using an app that showed how the process was proceeding.I took off from work on the day of stated delivery, was given a 9am-9pm delivery window, and in the morning the app showed everything was set, but just not out for delivery, so I waited until 7pm and called the freight company and was informed that I needed to wait until 9pm. Well the delivery wasn’t made, so again I checked the app the next morning and it showed it was out for delivery, so I took another day off, but since I am here writing this highly negative review, you can surmise it never showed up.This was particularly upsetting as most of the items were for my 84 year old dad, who ended up sleeping on an air mattress for an evening as we dissembled his bed after we saw the order was out for delivery, and naturally he was quite disappointed it never showed up.What followed were hours of unproductive phone calls over days, where the freight company blamed IKEA for not releasing their “hard hold” on the merchandise, who then said I needed to contact IKEA and resolve this, and in return with IKEA claiming the freight company had lost the items in their own warehouse.It is important to realize that both parties expected me to be the intermediary on their behalf in repeated phone call over days, and that each time I had to again contact IKEA the process took hour for each call that did finally connect, with the majority of calls leading one through a voice menu maze, which would then flat out tell you they could not answer your call at this time. Also, they really need to change their on-hold messages, as repeatedly telling the customer how simple and efficient the online ordering process is, and prodding them to go online instead (which gives one no resolution options), is infuriating.After all was said and done I easily spent over 8 hours total between IKEA and their designated freight company, with each blaming the other, only to finally have IKEA admit that it was their fault, and they simply didn’t have the items after all. I said to one of their reps, “I am going to ask to a straightforward question, is there any system in place to inform the customer that their order isn’t actually going to be delivered?”, to which he flatly replied “No”, and I laughed saying, “Well at least that’s an honest answer”. A subsequent interaction was, far worse with a different rep attempting to assign blame on me stating that I should have known that their system sends out an email confirming the order has been successfully processed, to which I pointed out I was also told that the freight company would inform me of delivery status, which they did, resulting in 2 days of lost work. She then continued the cycle of blaming the freight company, without accepting any responsibility of IKEA who of course should be overseeing the entire process involved in making sure their products are actually in stock, and are being actually delivered when their designated freight provider informs the customer of the pending delivery. Also note that the one go to option the reps kept pushing was to just cancel the order, obviously to take this issue off of their plate.So 1.5 months out from the original scheduled delivery date, I have received nothing, not a single item from the order, I have received no notification of status or redelivery scheduling, and I am quite convinced that no one even knows my order exists in the computer system as I have been specifically informed that there is no system in place to inform customers on delivery delays.IKEA is undoubtedly the worst online shopping experience I have ever encountered, with representatives that are functionally incapable of resolution options other than simply canceling the order, who don’t take primary responsibility for their incompetence, and are at times aggressively argumentative."

  "articleText": "I really wish I had read these reviews before ordering and paying for my furniture for my dressing room!! Went to the Edinburgh store and ordered everything except 4 pieces which were out of stock. Paid and organised delivery and was told to keep looking online for the other pieces to come into stock. Did this and phoned to add on to order. After 2 very long calls (on hold for 45 minutes each) I thought it was all sorted. Last Thursday the 4 additional pieces arrived at the house. The rest was to be collected from Aberdeen on Sunday. Call received late Sunday morning to say nothing had arrived as there was some mix up. After another very long wait on the phone I had a very unhelpful call with customer services, only to be told by the very bored sounding Ikea employee that it was a stock issue and some of the pieces were now out of stock!!! How could this be.....they were in stock at the time of payment so surely they should have been aside with my name on it?? It wasn't my fault that they couldn't deliver to Aberdeen sooner and I certainly wouldn't have expected that they would just go ahead and resell the units. The bored guy on the phone said....could be November.....or maybe next year!! But basically he really couldn't care less. So I am now £1200 out of pocket and have no idea what's happening because no one has been in touch with me since the Case was raised (whatever that means!!) I am probably going to have to take a day off work to go down yet again to sort this out and get my money back. My advice to anyone.....shop somewhere else as Ikea seems to be completely disorganised and uncaring towards their customers."

While redoing my studio I put in a order online in the middle of August, to be delivered to my local pick up point September 9.  I received a confirmation that my order was processed & so I waited to be notified when it was ready for me to pick it up.September 9 came & went, nothing, then September 10, I received an email containing a refund statement for the whole order. No explanation, apology or anything. So I phoned the one customer service number & waited an hour & 15 minutes before talking to a representative. He was pleasant enough but sounded very resigned to the whole situation without being able to give me any explanation for them completely dropping the ball. He quoted my return would be processed in 5-7 days on my visa, but gave me a case number to follow up with if that didn’t happen!So disappointed in this whole process, I waited weeks for a order that didn’t even leave the warehouse without any notice from IKEA at all. Poor, poor customer service. Such a shame I really do love their products but if I can’t get it to my city, what’s the point. I don’t live in the boonies, I live in the Capital city of Victoria, BC Canada. I will never order from IKEA again"

I try the chat, takes nearly an hour, person needs me to transfer to sales. Takes almost 40 minutes. Sales on the other end tells me there was an unexpected delay and it needs to be rescheduled for four days later. I asked why there wasn't even a courtesy call to let me know at the start of the day and I had people hired to move and assemble this furniture (it was furniture for the whole house), and even a normal person cannot be expected to figure this out automatically. The agent took a very cavalier \"take it or leave it attitude\" - with no guarantee to meet the next date, unable to change it to click and collect, and the possible refund taking an approximately 15 business days (I had already explained to him this was ~3k of furniture and if I have to re order, I can't wait three weeks in an empty house). I lost my temper a few times and used colorful language (never directing them at the agent though). I have NEVER went to that level with ANY customer support, all my life.He would only offer me a \"negotiable\" amount of IKEA gift card and if IKEA fails again.I have had so many good memories from this location, but this one incident will always leave me bitter."

I asked them if I could secure the item for pickup on Wednesday they said they could not and had no resolution they could assist with. But I would receive a refund after 14 days. I called today after more then 14 days. I was on the phone for an hour again. I was told it can take up to 3 weeks or longer. In the email I received it stated 14 days, the women told me it said business days, I assured her it did not and I would be happy to send her over the email. She declined but the same issue still remains. My refund has not been sent, my order was cancelled on their end and I have never received such poor customer service. I am over it IKEA and will never shop there again. I just want my $300.00 dollars back. To have my money for almost 3 months and to have a company be in no rush to give it back after I had to go out and repurchase the originally items is extremely irritating.

Waited early am for 1 hour and decided to leave the queue with the intention of coming back later only to find the same queue but longer late afternoon.

  "articleText": "Appalling service.  Don't buy anything from @IKEAUK they have completely done away with any customer service and use CoVid as an excuse. A system that relies on individual line items, with so many line items out of stock. Promises that it will be back in stock (If you are willing to travel hundreds of miles).  If you buy anything and have a problem it's like the wild west. You will waste hours and I mean LITERALLY hours trying to get through to customer services and they expect you to ring them to get a refund they promised.  But you can't get through to anyone - waiting, waiting, waiting - don't even know if I am in a queue. Atrocious.  I used to love IKEA but the experience is so painful I warn you, DO NOT BUY ANYTHING from this company they are awful and have given up pretending they care about their customers."

And there's no way to contact customer service!  The only option when clicking through to email IKEA is to cancel your order.  When you call, they tell you 3 times go online to check the status of your order, (where no additional information is available, I checked), but when you keep asking for customer service you then get a message that they can't take your call *click.*The website is garbage.  You check the status of the item in the store, and when you go to the store, the item is nowhere to be found and there are no clerks to be found to ask about it.  Online, when you fill your basket and are trying to check out, you only find out at the end that the items can't be delivered to you.  Click n Collect NEVER is available.The leadership of this company are garbage.  I'm not subjecting myself to their experiments in shopping torture anymore!"

Waited for about 20 minutes in return queue as had faulty chair to return and then 2 shelves that we just wanted to exchange for smaller size. Eventually get in to be told they will go get another chair but because the shelves are not faulty they'll only refund them and then we will need to go and wait in the other huge queue at the front of the shop. Meanwhile I'm bursting for the loo and am interrogated by the gestapo-like security guard when trying to get there who eventually let's me go without having to queue at front of shop again even though this toilet is literally right beside us and I'm already in store!Asked for manager to say all we want is two small shelves which were actually an exchange and could we just get them but told no. Ended up leaving as I can't face standing like that for another half hour heavily pregnant and because am totally disgusted at their ridiculous system. Upsetting when we have purchased all our nursery furniture and lighting in this store and the shelves were the finishing touches.They're so inconsiderate as had zero sympathy that I'm heavily pregnant which my husband pointed out to the members of staff involved.

This is their business, no complains.Then, after paying the whole ~10% shipping fee, the confirmation email came suggesting the order will be delivered by Aug 27th, what a smooth and fast procedure.But, after waiting days after the delivery days, and hours of frustrating wait in the queue of the online customer service chat, the agent simply implies that my order is out of stock!!!! Which was not when I ordered. Then they cancelled my order without any apologies or any type of compensation to show that they are embarrassed in any kind.DO NOT ORDER ONLINE from IKEA!"

  "articleText": "We have purchased (and assembled ourselves) 3 IKEA kitchens. I do really like their kitchen cabinets.However, their customer service is non existent.  Our IKEA built-in microwave oven broke down so we ordered a different oven.  We had to modify the IKEA cabinet that the oven is in, and needed different size doors.  As the kitchen system (SEKTION) is still being produced and the color name was identical to the kitchen we had  purchased (GRIMSLÖV), we thought this would be easy.  We were warned that the doors would take a long time (took about 6 weeks).  However, when we got the doors they were the wrong color.  I still had an extra deco piece still in the box, so I'm positive I got the color correct.  GRIMSLÖV is a medium reddish brown brown, but the doors we were sent were a dark chestnut  brown.  The two colors are not even close.  I attempted to contact IKEA, but \"due to heavy call volume\" they hung up on me.  I couldn't even leave my number for a call back.  I thought, okay I'll email them.  On their website they are only taking emails for canceled orders!  So they are making it impossible to contact them.  I sent an order cancelation anyway, but I don't hold out any hope that they'll respond.  I tried to find another email or phone number where I could talk to a person but no luck so far.If you are near an IKEA store (i.e. don't have to rent a hotel), then perhaps the customer service may not be so bad as you can go in person.  However, if you are not near one, then their customer service is so bad that you would be better off shopping somewhere else for your kitchen."

  "articleText": "There are no words to express how utterly disappointed I am in IKEA and your handling of your online orders.  It is absolutely understandable that you have had to make logistical changes to your operation during a time like this; however, a lack in handling of proper customer service is not only damaging to your consumer and reputation but also to your employees who are trying to cope with all of this.  I placed my order on May 4th, and I have been patiently waiting to receive it.  I even tried to cancel the order because word had arrived that the stores would be reopening, and for that time frame, I could just make the purchase at the store. I was excited to receive a notification back in June that my order was shipping only for the tracking of the package to be stagnate in Lakeland, FL. I have had no communication at all nor been able to reach anyone from IKEA since placing or attempting to cancel my order.  Yesterday, August 12th, I received a notification that my order had been delivered. Nothing was at my door and upon checking my package tracking, the same indication that my package has not left Lakeland, FL is in fact still there.  I find it ironic that this survey has been sent for me to share my experience concerning a customer service conversation that I have not had with anyone.  I would in the very least like a refund if you are not going to send my package.  As an alternative, I'm willing to pick the items up from my local IKEA store in Atlanta.  What I will not do is continue to wait for IKEA to decide that I, a consumer who used to advocate for IKEA and its products, am to be disregarded as nothing more than a money grab.  By all means, share this with the individual(s) who are in charge of this mess."

The delivery was scheduled for 08/29/2020 between 9am and 9pm. I received a confirmation e-mail from Ikea on 08/20/2020 indicating my order is being picked.It hasn't been delivered yet and the website still shows “On its way”. I have tried several times to contact them using the number (888) 888-4532 that is provided on their website but their automatic system keeps hanging up on me due to call volume.I have to say this is not a way to treat the customers."

  "articleText": "Not sure how these guys are still in business as I have tried many times to buy things from them to no avail! Online I tried over 3 days to buy a Hafslo mattress. The first day it kept bugging out when trying to check out the item. The next day I managed to get to the checkout but the only checkout option was to collect from their Tottenham store - 50 miles away. Even though there are half a dozen stores closer, all with stock of the item. Yesterday, getting slightly impatient I drove to the store only to be faced with a 2 mile long queue. Today I have tried again to purchase the mattress only for the little revolving sofa animation to repeat itself endlessness in the checkout without actually doing anything. Hmm. Definitely think I will give their website a miss from now on."

  "articleText": "Bought a table of Ikea.com and it was supposed to arrive in a few days. After about a month of waiting, it still had not arrived. I wondered what the problem was and I looked up if they were having trouble mailing to my area. I found a social media post by them saying that they are having trouble and almost all the comments were from costumers saying Ikea had not delivered their items. I saw another social media post very similar on facebook. They claimed their issues delivering are due to the virus, but the first social media post was from 2 years ago. I finally got a refund after contacting the better business bureau about the problem. When I had contacted Ikea directly on the phone, a robot said the line was busy and then hung up. When I contacted them on social media, I never got a response. Ikea later sent me a $20 gift card as a way to make things better I guess, but It didn't even work. If they can not deliver items they should not be offering that as a part of their business. Very unprofessional. Also, if do accept payment with no intent on actually giving the buyer their item, they are no better than thieves."

That in it’s self is not great but not a big deal.   However, when I received it it was completely broken.  Our local store said there were 18 in stock so my husband went to return only the bottom since I bought the lid and container separately.  When he got there there were none available.  When I have tried to reach out to get customer service on the phone I get a recording saying they are too overwhelmed and then get hung up on.  This is not ok.  A business should never operate like this.  Especially a large business.  I ordered my container on line due to COVID and then had to go to the store anyway.  This is not ok.

Now they are refusing to replace the doors. They have the 2nd worst customer service in the whole world. First being another company selling furniture up North. I will never ever buy anything ever from IKEA ever again. Please please please avoid buying a kitchen from them. Go to Howdens anyone else. If anything goes wrong they don't care. They are slow, inefficient and don't communicate with each other departments. You will likely end up like me with faulty shoddy kitchen doors, then get left in the limbo for months on end."

On the date of exchange we have ZERO communication form Ikea and nothing turn up. So I waited in all day for nothing. When I got in contact with them they told me there was no stock. To clarify I had to wait an hour on the phone after waiting in all day to be told this. Rebooked the exchange. Called two days prior to check the delivery would take place. Again waited on the phone for over an hour - when I got through I was told there was no stock and the exchange wouldn't be taking place. If I hadn't of rung I would have spent all day waiting in again for no delivery. Rebooked the exchange again. I called Monday - waited an hour and a half on the phone to be told the exchange would take place. Called yesterday to double check, again confirmed it was taking place and to call back at tea time to get a delivery time. Used the web chat at tea time, waited an hour to connect to someone who told me there was no delivery date or time on our order and she then ended the chat. Called Ikea was on hold for 90mins with no answer. Called Ikea this morning at 7am - the exchange took place at 8.40am and guess what - the wrong items were exchanged based on what they had on their sheet. I've been offered as compensation a £20 E-Voucher to spend in store. No refund for the time I have taken off work to try and resolve this. Whilst I appreciate COVID has affected all businesses  your communication strategy is diabolical. I will be taking this higher as this is genuinely the worst customer service I have ever received.

This poorly organised company stole many hours of my time and provided no resolution to my problem which was caused by themselves. I ordered a Hamavarik mattress which arrived and appeared to have no inside in it! I asked for an exchange she said she was happy to do that and when I requested a refund for delivery as this mattress clearly was falsely advertised she turned round and said \"nah\". With that same employee she gave me a number to call to pay the difference for the exchange therefore I hung up after being on the phone for 75 minutes to realise she gave me the same number I was just calling on!Disaster strikes.. I had to spend my afternoon attempting to wrap my poorly advertised mattress in bin liners and upon finishing I'd wasted hours of my time.This is where it gets juicy, I FINALLY paid the difference which took me two days to do as first the payment system was down and the following day all phone lines were down. When I finally got through I paid and then received an email to say my payment was late which means the exchange has been delayed, delayed!!! through no fault of mine! their systems were down and now I'm paying the price.Overall, If you've got some change in your pocket save up a little longer and go somewhere decent and save yourself the pain and misery of talking to employees from IKEA."

If you try to email, only option is to cancel an order..oh and you have 48 hours to report an issue or they consider the order complete. hmmm   So called back and chose the option to place an order..OH Wow, what a surprise, a human answers when you want to place an order but not when you have an issue.  The customer service agent was very helpful and processed a replacement...but the ship date didn't get communicated until 2 days later and it is 3 weeks out.  REALLY?  So now sleeping on a mattress on the floor until they get around to delivering it.  Can only hope it will be right.   Also, no apology, no offer of a store coupon or credit against the order for the inconvenience.  If they had showed one ounce of apology for the issue, I would not be nearly as upset.  Not sure how they stay in business when pretty much every delivery order is messed up it seems.  They are 0 for 2 with us."

That was Fine.Then I got a notification at 16:10 that my delivery had arrived at 10:30 which it hadn't then refreshed and got that it was delivered at 16:05 so i then got on to customer service web chat after another 45 mins wait the told me that they will have to search the warehouse for my order which would take 3-5 days and then reorder my items and send it out again and then ended the chat there.so i rang customer service again for now the 10th time trying to get through to them, a nice man answered herd everything i had to say and he himself was confused why my delivery had been marked delivered he then got in contact with the delivery manager who then rang my partner and said that the delivery driver feck up and crossed off our order as delivered when he actually delivered the one below ours e.g ours was no.3 on his list he delivered no.4 but ticked off no.3 , so the manager then told us that they were very sorry and will deliver the order this morning (22/08/20) between 10-11am.Did it arrive? No! I ring the delivery manager at 13:08 and ask him to find out where it is ,turns out the delivery driver was never even told that he was to deliver my order today so he will now deliver it tomorrow morning!Absolutely disgraceful i had to pay €74 for this delivery and service absolutely shocking i will never be ordering from IKEA again and neither should you ."

They delivered it in May, but one box was missing (an important one at that).They told me that it was back-ordered in Canada and that they didn't even know when they would get one, but they told me not to worry and that I would get it in time for my remodel in August. In July, someone from customer support called me and told me that they could get one delivered on August 20th, so I planned my assembly / kitchen remodel for August 21th, because well, I wasn't going to waste another day without a freaking kitchen.I was there from 9AM to 9PM, near the front door not even taking the time to freaking eat. I wasted an entire day for that item, and they didn't even come.So I tried to call them, chat with them, nothing. You get on hold and get flushed after 2 hours. They won't even answer on Facebook messenger.How is IKEA still alive and well with such a poor customer support?"

I told her that due to a health condition, I can't. Then she turned her back and said, \"Then find another sales person\". I said \"OK\" and we went to a line to another sales person. Then she came back and said \" Since he is busy, you can order items online\".  I told her that if you have them now, we want to buy since  we made a 50min drive to the store. However, she was insisting to look online because, as she said, nobody in the store will serve me without covering nose. We had to drive back home without being helped.

In a large expensive wardrobe (far more expensive than than the market average) the last thing you'd worry about is the plastic holder of the metal rail. Yet, ridiculously, the metal rail holder snapped and collapsed with a only few clothes hangers, a moderate load, within a few hours from installation..Many other details, metal hinges, plastic accessories, stopped matching, and break as if they are made of ice or dough.A very expensive LED bathroom mirrored shelf doesn't have a switch - the most basic expectation when selling an electrified item.IKEA global.Beware fake ratings. Product ratings aren't available on all Ikea domains (understandable since the products are only getting worse) . But where they are, such as in Canada, they are fraudulent. Example: On a  Komplement hanging rail for the hugely overpriced  PAX modular wardrobes they listed 35 rating, 30 of them being negative (1 out of 5 stars), mostly because it breaks straight away. Ikeas fake product rating however, ended up showing as 4.4 out of 5. That's low, IKEA, very low...IKEA Ireland, Dublin.(Older review)Product gets 4 stars out of 5 (due to Ikea systems).In-store Customer service in Dublin gets 0 stars out of 5 (most Irish staff are sour-faced with unhelpful and hostile attitude, and they make you feel like you're inconveniencing them with your non-sense questions). Horrible experience doesn't begin to describe it. Narrow minded 1d10ts, who don't appreciate yuo are paying their salaries, even when you spend many thousands euro shopping in IKEA. Luckily there are a few foreign staff who are infinitely nicer and more helpful.That's what typically happens when the government gives a new company the green light, but conditions them to mostly hire the \"deprived\" locals. In this case the good but entitled folk from Ballymun...IKEA call centreCall center gets 3 star out of 5 (nice and helpful staff, obviously based outside Ireland. But despite estimating that you'll wait 1-2 minutes, they keep you waiting for 28 minutes)IKEA kitchen design teamNice enough staff, but largely inexperienced, very quick to advice me to place large fixed filler panels in a space where they just didn't know how to insert other smaller modules (from their readily available ranges). Needless to say wasting priceless space in kitchens is almost criminal, particularly when storage space comes at a massive premium. Due to their poor design advise, I cut kitchen counters shorter than they needed to be. So I had to add it back later with unsightly visible joints..I ended up redesigning portions of my modular kitchen, returning the useless but expensive glossy filler panels and replacing them with more valuable  modular presses and drawers in IKEA..IKEA delivery serviceDelivered from IKEA's Galway hub, our paid delivery arrived on time. However all the large sized PAX doors, made of mirror, bathroom shelf doors, also made of glass, specifically marked as FRAGILE had plenty of boots marks on them. Complete disregard for Customer and their paid product."

I called back a week later and they informed me that my order had been canceled on May 27th,2020. I have no idea why they took it upon themselves to cancel my order and not send me any notice. The biggest problem is that they cancelled my order but NEVER refunded my money $185. I have since called twice was given a case number and been told I needed to wait 5-7 business days. It has now been 16 business days since my first phone call and they STILL have not refunded my money. I can’t even get through anymore. This is THEFT... they have stolen my money.

  "articleText": "Insanely bad experience. Ikea was out of stock on several items in my cart and since they don't have any ability to order items and wait for them to come in stock, I waited almost 2 months to put the order in. I finally was able to order the full kitchen in early July. The delivery date from Ikea was set for July 24. Next thing I know, the delivery service (XPO Delivery) randomly showed up at my door with my order on July 22.\"Hello this is your Ikea delivery. We are at your house.\"No one was home. \"Why are you there? The delivery is scheduled for July 24.\"\"We are here now. Do you want us to leave everything in your driveway?\"\"No, it's going to rain.\"\"Ok, you will need to reschedule the delivery.\" That night I got \"Your delivery was a success!\" confirmation emails from both Ikea and XPO.This entire time, due to Covid-19, Ikea was not taking any customer service calls or emails - only emails to cancel orders. I called XPO. They said only Ikea can reschedule the delivery and I need to wait. I wait for a week. Nothing. I call XPO back and the XPO rep says they have a new delivery date of August 7. I am annoyed but at least the delivery is set.On August 5, I get a \"Delivery rescheduled\" confirmation email for Sunday *August 9*. I call and ask what happened to August 7? XPO says they don't know but the delivery is definitely Sunday, August 9. \"The delivery is scheduled for some time between 9am and 9pm.\"Today is August 9. I called XPO twice during the day to confirm the delivery was on its way. \"Yes, they are in transit.\"After sitting at home all day waiting for the delivery (on a Sunday), at 8:35pm I called XPO to get a status. \"Oh yes, your order is not coming today.\"\"WHY NOT?!\"\"I have no more information. I will transfer you to Ikea to reschedule the delivery.\"...\"You're hold time for the next Ikea representative is...75 minutes.\"So I am writing this as I wait on hold with Ikea. I fully expect to be disconnected before someone answers, or they are going to say \"XPO has your order. You must talk to them to reschedule.\"Meanwhile, this has gone on so long, I have lost the contractor who was scheduled to install everything, as they had to move on to other jobs.I want to cut some slack to businesses in these difficult times, but screwing up the date 4 times, with absolutely no recourse and terrible/no communication is ridiculous. And to make someone sit at home on a weekend and wait for a delivery that never comes - after confirming multiple times it's on its way - is beyond maddening.If this ever gets resolved, it will be my last Ikea purchase for a loooong, loooong time."

  "articleText": "Worst customer service ever. Tried multiple times, and multiple ways, to purchase an ottoman.When I called customer service and was told it was out-of-stock, I was also told I would receive an email when it was in stock. I never received such an email even though I noted on the website it was back in stock. I went back to the store only to find it was mysteriously closed without any notification on the website. Returned home and decided to order online. Called numerous times to check status of order and each customer service rep told me something that contradicted the prior person. Finally received an email it would be delivered on a set date. Well, on that date, the doorbell did ring and a driver from Ikea was at the door. The driver had a small package. It was the fabric for the ottoman and not the ottaman! Spent three hours trying to reach customer service. Finally reached a human who said it was on backorder. Yet my email confirmation of the order I placed indicated the entire ottoman would be arriving. Not the fabric!!!! I did not spend $215 to buy a piece of fabric. Will NEVER shop with IKEA again. Horrible, horrible customer service."

Come 8/8.. text from ikea that it will be rescheduled! If you are spending 2000$ on furniture, the least you expect is basic customer service! Can’t even review the product as I have not received it after 3 weeks and I am not sure if I will receive it ever!

Well guess what? get home, missing parts! go back, cause no one will answer a phone and online is useless, a manager finally got us the parts we were missing ( I will say he was way more helpful) ok get home start putting the bed together again, NO HOLES IN THE BOARDS TO SCREW IT TOGETHER! So we have a bed now half put together with no drawers where they should be and once again no one will answer a phone! Never shop there, better off paying the extra somewhere else or even building your own furniture! I wish they let me post pictures!"

  "articleText": "Ikea Order # 356488809 -Customer service file #230 - 20529996 -My experience with Ikea is so heartless and so horrible! First off I ordered my items last June 8, 2020. And the delivery should have been on July 12 but until now we’re on July 30 and still the delivery company of Ikea which is XPO logistics is screwing up in delivering my items. They re-scheduled me for 2nd time on a Sunday afternoon, I received a call from delivery driver a day before to confirm and I thought it’s going to be successfully delivered this time , but then on that day , I waited again for nothing, wasting 4 hours of my time . I could have gone somewhere for my other errands. I called up the driver who called me a day before because their customer service in XPO is closed on a Sunday and now his reason was that the delivery truck got broken and so my parcel had to be transferred to another truck with a different driver! Why they didn’t inform me?! I really don’t understand why! And so the next business day , tried to reach Ikea Customer Service , they rescheduled me again for the 3rd time, again I waited and spent 4 hours of my time at home waiting in vain for the 3rd time . This time they couldn’t give me an answer. I’m literally losing my patience already of their false hopes and false reassurances. I reached them out in Social media fb and instagram but seems like they don’t care and don’t really read my concerns. They keep on asking for my order # and keep on saying apologies but the problem is not being fixed at all.  And now still giving them a chance for the fourth time to re-schedule me for today Thursday July 30, I called up XPO an hour prior to my delivery time frame to make sure , the agent said my parcel is already loaded in the truck, it’s on its way and that they’re shouldn’t be any problem. So I got an alert at 1pm that they’re coming in 30 minutes , 2pm passed , still nothing arrives. 3 pm passed and I’m still waiting, I called up again , and the agent said just wait since driver still has 5pm to arrive. So as usual, 5 pm passed but none came. I called up again , and now this is the shocking answer of the agent , “I’m sorry but you’re parcel won’t be delivered today unfortunately because the driver didn’t able to find your order..”-What!!!? Are u kidding me?!Now they have two contrary statements from previous agent. I mean what kind of service is this?! It’s not easy to wait on queue to speak to someone who can help when no one actually wants to help. I have to wait for so long just to reach someone, I’m trying to ask for a Supervisor to call me back but no one did. They only want you to call their Customer Service hotline that’s gonna make you wait for years and they just put u on hold . I don’t understand why no one from any of them is calling me back when I already told them my availability which is 7pm onwards everyday. The worst part for today that’s making me mad right now is I took a day off from work! Just for this delivery that’s not happening, who is going to compensate me for the hours of work that I lost ?? Because of irresponsible people who don’t actually care for their customers?! Till now no one is reaching out to me for a resolution.."

First of all, delivery of a shower curtain and rod or a king sized bed to anywhere downtown Toronto costs $69. How ridiculous that this is the charge in this day and age. Second of all, beginning of June I ordered a bunch of items and chose the click & collect option for July 21st. How ridiculous again that your staff can't put aside a few items any sooner than a month and a half. Third, I was sent no email following up what time I should pick up the order so I call them. An hour and a half later, they pick up and give me a bunch of useless information about my order (like how much it amounted to - why?!) only to tell me that NO ONE has prepared my order and It's therefore, not ready. I was asked to order again with no availability to pick up until September 11th!!!! I asked the lady \"Why doesn't Ikea just send my few things on a delivery truck? This is inconvenient since I have already waited a long time\" And that lying woman says \"Oh no trucks in that area\" It's downtown Toronto near Yonge Street and I see your trucks almost every day in the neighbourhood. DISAPPOINTING!!! Get your website together and train for better service."

I am also the owner of a $50 cushion with no patio chair to put it on.July 7 – ordered a patio chair and cushion.  My credit card was charged.July 12 – Waited at home on a Sunday for the delivery.  Patio Chair and Cushion delivered.  Driver did not bring items up to my condo so I lugged them up myself.  When I got upstairs one item was not mine so I called delivery dispatch and had them come back.  Carried item back downstairs and got correct item.  When I opened the chair, the materials were unraveling.  Packed the item back up and called IKEA customer service.  1 hour and 25m to get someone on the phone.  New order for chair and pick-up of defective chair requested.July 13 – Received 2 confirmation #’s for my new order and delivery date of July 20, 5-9 p.m.  Also received a voice mail confirming this time and that the pick-up of the defective chair would be the day before or after.  Then received confirmation of the defective chair pickup for July 21, 1-5:00.  In the meantime I have had to store a very large box in my 650sf condo while waiting for this pick-up.July 20th – Stayed home in the evening for my delivery of the new chair. There was no delivery.  I called the delivery dispatch at 8 p.m. and they said the order had been cancelled.  I was not aware of this or why that would be.  No communication and IKEA has had my payment since July 7.  I then tried to call IKEA customer service and got a message saying that the lines are too busy and to try another time.July 21 – Tried again to cll IKEA customer service.  Same message saying that the lines are too busy and to try another time.July 22 – I have currently been in some kind of queue since 9 a.m. this morning with no answer.  It is 2 and a half hours later.  Your chat function has never been available throughout all of this."

Typically I prefer to praise positive experiences over pointing the finger at things that don't go as intended, and with everything that's taking place with COVID, this is even more the case. That said, after paying for expedited 3 day shipping on May 28th, having multiple customer service agents make commitments that weren't met, more than 10 hours on the phone between my partner and I continually being pushed to different departments without any resolution about where our items are or how we can address this problem this has been without a doubt, the worst customer experience I've ever had. I can appreciate and understand challenges with delivery, items being lost or life happening, but the utter disregard for customer experience in this case is very surprising for a company that I used to think took this type of experience seriously. While I don't imagine it means much to the organization, I genuinely hope that others choose to shop elsewhere instead of going through this."

I spent a very long time on hold yesterday to schedule this delivery and was told by both NAL and IKEA that this date was available and my delivery had been scheduled.  The person, I talked to, Brittany, was very condescending and not the least bit helpful in why this mix up has hapenned.  Just to state \"we are a very busy company\".  This is very poor customer service.   Why would I be told my delivery was scheduled for July 22 by two people only to receive an email to schedule it for the above dates to only be told by Brittany that those dates were not available either????????One very unhappy customer!"

Agent changed delivery day/time with me to Thursday 7am-1pm..Again I wait all day and no one turns up. I got through to an agent yesterday afternoon who told me he directly rang the courrier himself, the courier said a delivery man hadnt turned up for work that morning so they were running late with my order and now it wouldnt be out till sometime before 6pm but that the courrier was enroute to me so I would definitely get it. Again it was a no show! Was on the phone to an agent in England this morning for 1 hour. She got in touch with the store and the customer service manager needs to go down to the warehouse and check this out for me and will ring me then. Hours have passed now and still no word. This is appalling service. I paid for the goods and the items to be picked and delivered on Sunday..I'm now waiting all week. This has been a complete waste of my time.

Most recently 2 terrible experiences that have left me an ex-customer1) Wanted to replace an item we had that has just got past it used by date and has started to break apart - it was cheap so in itself not a drama.  It becomes expensive though when you make the effort to go online and check stock levels and when the item is highlighted as green and in stock (not even yellow i.e. low stock) we drive the kms to the store only to find that they have none there - not 1…so from plenty of stock to none in 1 hour?  Speaking to a \"Service\" person there we were told we should have CALLED the store before coming over - really!???2) I received a $10 voucher for having spent in January - March. Got a \"reminder\" (noting this was the FIRST notification I had received) a week before it expired.  Tried to order the item online (that was not in stock at the store we had just been to) the online checkout said it was not valid.Tried to call the store - no answer.Tried to use their online form - and noted the timeline - only to get no answer.Tried again - noting the first enquiry to which I had no response…. (this is now after the voucher expired) - finally get an answer 19 days after I first tried to get help to be told \"We provide a voucher each quarter via email to your email address and you then have 3 months to use this voucher.Once this period has expired we can no longer honor this voucher.\"Clearly they did not read my first, or even second contact ion any meaningful way so I respond to cancel my Ikea Family membership and have all my details removed from their system. Interestingly on this one got a response in less than 48 hours cancelling.  Car factor in their response - zero!"

Lots of other tables had dirty dishes piled high. No one whatsoever was seen cleaning the tables either and the venue was packed. I’m sure IKEA makes enough money that they can employ people to clean the tables. No one wants or expects to eat at a dirty table. I used anti bacterial wipes to clean our tables before eating.I won’t be eating at IKEA again.Get your act together IKEA. The dirty conditions of the food hall were unsatisfactory, unhygienic and a health disaster waiting to happen. I felt sick to the stomach."

  "articleTitle": "AWFUL \"Customer Service\"",
  "articleText": "I ordered a Closet Unit and 3-tiered Cart on 5/22 and scheduled my delivery for 7/3 when I originally placed the order.I took a day off of work to ensure I was home for the deliver which is stated to be between 9AM - 9PM.  I got 3 emails (1 the week before, and 2 the morning before) stating that my delivery would arrive on 7/3.On the morning of 7/3, I called the Delivery Company (Select Express & Logistics) to see if they had a more accurate time for my delivery (morning, afternoon, or evening).  I was not told until that morning that my ordered had arrived from Ikea to their location the day before and DID NOT make it on the truck to be delivered on 7/3.I was immediately angry because I had gotten several reminder emails from Ikea saying everything was on track and to expect my delivery on 7/3.  When I talked to the Delivery Company they said I wouldn't get it until Monday 7/6.  I argued with them for a while and then asked who would be refunding my delivery fee, paying my lost wages for taking the day off because you have to be there to accept your delivery, or who they were going to pay OT to in order to ensure my delivery made it to my house either on 7/3 or 7/4.  They wouldn't help and wouldn't let me speak to a Supervisor.  They told me to call Ikea.So I called Ikea and got transferred to the \"after sales customer service team\".  The woman was awful - wouldn't listen, wouldn't help and I asked her all of those same three questions above.  She also wouldn't let me speak to a Supervisor.  She said there was no way that they would refund my delivery fee or do anything else I asked.  So basically they were going to do nothing for me - No Customer Service! She said I didn't have to take the day off of work because they call to give you a window time.  Really?  Because I had to call on that morning just to be told that my order wasn't even coming until Monday, July 6th!Why does Ikea allow you to pick your delivery date on their site when you order a product from them IF THEY AREN'T GOING TO DELIVER ON THAT DAY - AND SOMEONE HAS TO BE HOME THAT IS OVER 18! If there was a back up or any type of issue due to COVID then call me and let me know that you need to reschedule so that I don't lose wages!  I shouldn't have to call you just to be told that they aren't delivering.  I would've NEVER known they weren't coming on 7/3, had I not called that morning to find out when my delivery was supposed to arrive (morning, afternoon, or evening).  It was the WORST \"Customer Solutions\" experience EVER!Seriously, rent a U-Haul and go to the store to pick it up yourself.  It's not worth the large delivery fee and bs that you go through just to get the order on time after waiting OVER A MONTH!  I could've gotten it MUCH SOONER and not went through all this bs!"

She would call me back after investigating. Heard nothing and decided after a few days to go. Just went and they gave me my articles as if nothing wrong. Only I asked about the potential missing one and was told to count the 43 items expected (so sub items even though I only ordered 5 main articles). They couldnt be bothered checking themselves despite me askinf. Not customer friendly. Counting, we saw only 39 of the 43. The staff did not even know what was missing, despite calling to their own customer service (again they could not 'see\"  into their own systems. Apparently I have to wait and it (they) will be delivered at home. Sometime. Nobody knows what or when only that there is a 'manco' (something not correct with the order) which was handwritten on a sticker, randomly placed on one of the many boxes. This is terrible. What year is this? I am totally unimpressed and advise you not to order online to pick up (and pay nearly 10 euros for the privelidge) with these clowns..."

The processed the payment right away but never got the product.  i called maybe 20-30 times at different times only to get the machine that said, \"Due to high volume of calls....\" but that wasn't true.  There was NO ONE on the calls for customer service.  Finally two weeks ago (a month from when i ordered) they said it would be delivered July 11th.  But nothing has been processed yet.  I have no faith that it will be delievered by Saturday the 11th.  I specifically ordered this for a few summer gatherings (including a graduation).  IKEA fell off in the worst way.  And I hope it goes down for it.

I received a confirmation email with all the details. The delivery day came and went without a word from IKEA. I phoned promptly at 930a this morning and was put through the phone tree, was advised I'd be transferred to an agent and then was cut off. I phoned back, went through the tree, was put on hold for 10min and then got an agent. She advised me my my order was never delivered because all items are out of stock. Because it was before 10a EST she advised that I had to call back later to get more information or reschedule delivery. Ridiculous that this is their process. I phoned back at 10a and got an automated message advising that my call could not be completed. I tried again and received another message advising that due to high inquiry volumes they cannot take calls at this time. I tried five minutes later and was given the same message. I understand that COVID has thrown business into a tailspin, but the response to problems is what defines your customer service. This is appalling. Ikea were quick to take my money and then provide no updates or adequate assistance.UPDATE 7/20/20 : After several attempts and alot of time spent, I was able to get through to someone to cancel my order. The refund took 2 weeks.They've lost me as a customer."

I also received 5 packages of Besta hardware that I did not order. My guess is that 5 of my hinge sets were sent to someone who ordered 5 Besta cabinets and I got 5 sets of their hardware. Anyway, I tried several times to contact IKEA on the customer service number and my call was refused when I used the menu directions for delivery problems. So I used the menu item for new orders and customer service immediately answered my call. I reported the problem to the representative and she transferred me and I was on hold for 30 minutes. Then someone picked up and I told them about the problem and they put me on hold for another 15 minutes. Finally they said they would send me 5 more sets of hinges. So now, having waited a month to get my doors, I will now wait another 3 weeks to have my order completed. Some companies are thriving during this COVID crisis and others are using it as an excuse to give poor service. I can report to you that IKEA falls into the latter category."

So, on their track process it says being picked.  It takes days for that process to be completed.  It's a blanket!  Either somebody is going to get the order or they are not.  It doesn't take 2-3 days to find a blanket.  Next your order is being prepared.  Apparently it takes a few days for that as well... boxing a blanket. What, does Ikea do; chop the tree and process the wood to make cardboard on site before they can make a box?  Next, it has shipped, as of the 26th... yeah!  Only when checking tracking as of the 4th, it still shows they are creating a label, so it hasn't shipped, and apparently they need to chop down another tree to make the paper for the label.  Horrible company to order from!  Never again.  Nebraska Furniture Mart is the way to go.  I should have stuck with them."

  "articleTitle": "So, bad I purchased elsewhere",
  "articleText": "Ikea doesn't seem to get it as a company. People want to be able to order on website and then pickup, yet Ikea doesn't offer its Click&Connect. It makes no sense why they're forcing customers to go into the store to make a purchase, especially when they have had the months of April, May, June to make adjusts (+3 months if anyone is counting). More than 3 months and yet they can't get their act together. I was going to purchase 2 stefan chairs and chair pads ($70?). Honestly, I feel that is overpriced, but whatever. When trying to order on website it won't let me place the order for Click&Connect pickup at store, or for delivery. So, instead I went to my local Costco type warehouse store and got 2 chairs I like for $44.The only way this behavior on Ikea's part makes any sense logically is: they just don't care about us customers.  They could of easily setup a store pickup system in 3 months and hired extra people for it. They just don't care about their customers, or our business. They are making the assumption that the people who are super loyal to Ikea will keep going there, no matter what."

Ordered something estimated to be delivered May 25 it is now July and haven't even received an update on new delivery date. Also Placed an $800 order that was estimated to be delivered June 25th and haven't received any notification for delivery on these items either. Attempting to call or email is impossible IKEA Does not even give you the option to speak with someone directly over the phone and the only thing you can email about is canceling an order. So now we have no choice but to cancel our $800 order. Even considering the times IKEA should still have some way to get in contact with someone or keep you informed if your delivery will be delayed. Absolutely terrible - will never order from IKEA again."

The 365 day no nonsense return policy should be changed to 365 seconds return policy - meaning you goods can be returned up until you leave the car park . Zero star rating!!"

Waited at home all day for scheduled sofa delivery, then spent 3.5 hours (I am not joking) trying to get through to their customer support via phone and chat. When I get a response, they tell me it will probably come tomorrow and that they have delayed all deliveries by approx 24 hours (but have not told customers, despite having my correct email, phone, etc). I said I would like to make a complaint about not being informed of the delay and also about not being able to get through to customer service and they said that such a complaint would \"according to their strict matrix\" merit a 20 euro voucher but could not be further investigated. I told them to keep the voucher.  No idea if and when the sofa will turn up, but the arrogance of this company has shocked me. I think they are perhaps using Covid as an excuse to lower standards/cut costs?"

The Customer Service agent responded that a 1.45 hour wait was \"good these days.\" I was told \"someone would call me to arrange delivery\" for a new table leg. Days passed however, no call. I had to wait over 50 minutes to be connected with someone on Ikea Chat who had a very delayed response time (almost 6-7 minutes each response) only to find out I had to be transferred to \"after sales\" department. There is no extensions to call specific departments within Ikea and they direct you to call the general number with very extensive wait-times. My issue remains unresolved. Very disappointing customer service experience overall."

At one time they’re going to send me shelves and doors for a wardrobes I will never receive-since they deleted them from my order.From late May, I started to receive the items, at the time of writing I have had four deliveries, two were of duplicate items and after all of that I’m still missing a shoe cabinet, this Includes today’s delivery, which I had to reject since I already told customer service that I have the items and I want to return the duplicate ones they sent. Of course, they have failed to inform the courier about the collection and my tiny place’s corridor is another IKEA store at the moment!My complaint is not about the delivery- we are going through a pandemic and totally understand that.Majority of the drivers we nice and helpful..it’s customer service that keep messing about in the backrooms, at one intense an agent told me my order was modified by a ‘ higher authority’ and he couldn’t undo that or go against management decisions. I clearly told them I don’t mind waiting as long I’m getting my items but receiving duplicates cluttering my limited space and no help from customer service is stressful and I wouldn’t recommend anyone to order form their until they get themselves together.After three hours wait.. I have been told by the agent I will be contacted to arrange the collection when the local store is open…it has been open since the beginning of the month, which he replied they don’t have permission to collect contradicting the statement from the last agent.Been horrible 3 months and counting ."

One employee told me, \"what can we do if customers don't follow the rules?\"  The answer is simple, kick them out of the store.  Ikea's lack of oversight and enforcement has created a truly dangerous environment and I hope I survive the experience.  I went from Ikea to Traders Joes.  What a difference.  In short, I went from one store which clearly does not care about the health of its customers to another which takes customer health seriously.

  "articleText": "I have placed an online order on 7th of June with a promised delivery date of June 9th. I also booked an assembly service for 15th of June. This is what happened afterwards:- On June 9th, nothing arrived and nobody contacted me. I chatted with customer service and they said they could not do anything and I have to wait for Amsterdam IKEA to contact me! Since I had no idea when my order would arrive, obviously I had to re-book the assembly to a later date, which I did (27th of June)- My order arrived 1 week after the promised date. However, two items were missing, including a big working desk! Of course the delivery guys had no idea about it, it is not their fault so they couldn't help me.- I contacted customer service again. We booked the delivery of the remaining two items for Monday 22nd of June between 9.00 - 16.00- On Monday 22nd of June, around 15.30, I received a message saying that my order has been cancelled and they can not deliver that day. How the **** does my order get cancelled without me knowing, I have no idea!!!!!!-  I kindly asked if I could add an item to my order (since it had arrived yet) and my request was rejected. I had to re-book the delivery for Wednesday 24th. Finally the two missing items arrived on that day.- The website states that I would have been contacted half an hour before the delivery of my orders but I was contracted in neither of the 2 orders I received. As you can guess, I am working from home and I had to step out of 2 different calls due to IKEA delivery!!!!! If I had known what time they would arrive, I would have arranged my schedule accordingly.- Now it's 27th of June, I was supposed to have assembly service today but I have no idea if they will come or at what time they will pop up. I can not reach customer service, I am tied to my house, having to wait for the slim chance that somebody shows up. This is ridiculous! There's absolutely no client eccentricity in this whole process, nobody even apologized for all this mess. This is the last time I am ever shopping with IKEA in Netherlands."

Delivery is terrible. Yes, I know COVID-19 has made things difficult but they charged me €55 for express delivery, gave me a date and then heard nothing for 2 days. Now delivery is postponed. What about my express delivery charge?3. It’s impossible to talk to customer service. The lines are often closed bec they’re too busy (seriously? You’re one of the few companies making money now, invest in support people!). Their chat system crashed on me several times after long waits. I spent about 5h last week chasing missing items from another delivery.I like their style, they seem to be going the right way when it comes to sustainability but not worth the headache."

I used their email service twice that says \"we will contact you shortly\" but still haven't been contacted a week later. Never ordering from them again. I also ordered online becuase their store was a zoo - they had two check out lines open that lined up all the way back to the cart pickup area. There was one lady there directing lines that was telling everyine with small items to go ahead while large items had to wait?!!! This company is a mess. I would guess they will be going out of business in the next year or two or less."

Looking at all these terrible reviews is disturbing but not shocking as they have literally ALWAYS been horrible.I ordered a bunch of stuff we need for the house and chose to pick up .... I set the date for the next day, which was the only option available and chose the time slot 6-8 so I could go after work. However they aren’t even open after 6 so how was I able to schedule this pickup? They have not sent me any emails to update me on my order, I spent 1/2 hr on hold with customer service only to give up. Now I check the status page and it says it’s in transit but I did not ship these items.Not sure what to do as they only have one customer service line and you cannot directly call any of their locations which is beyond dumb. Now during covid I’m going to have to risk my safety to go down to IKEA just to see what is going on with my order.All other companies have offered free pickup and often given deals on shipping.... not IKEA. They kept their doors open till the very last possible second, putting countless lives at risk all to make a buck.People shop here because there quite frankly are no other affordable options....so this greedy, unscrupulous company is able to rack in the $$$ offering nothing but crappy customer service and cheap, overpriced products you assemble yourself with a great deal of effort and frustration.They have cornerstoned the market and need to be dethroned, consumers need choice and right now there are no choices when it comes to affordability... this is why IKEA gets away with being so terrible"

No information about this was shared with me whatsoever. Waited a long time to talk to customer service the answer was: oh yeah we are behind on deliveries it will take at least a week more but cannot really say, you will receive a tracking code when its send. How is it even possible that company does not know when already paid customer orders (on stocked items) are being send? So now I just keep waiting, without any idea when these items might arrive.

Again, literally no way to contact them.Don't make the mistake of buying online from them.They also seem to be using covid restrictions as an excuse to have no form of customer service operating, or any way to contact them.

Once that date passed we started calling customer service.  This number was a consistent dead end with a computerized voice stating to \"call back later\".  It wasn't until 5/29/20 that we pressed 1 for \"place a new order\" and of course, received a live person.  This person internally transferred us to a customer service associate, who explained an error occurred on their end, and even though our credit card was billed for $1,500 on 4/28/20, the order was never placed.  When the associate went to re-place the order, we were told the couch was now sold out.  The associate told us our credit card would be credited for the $1,500 within a week of the call, which would have been June 5th.  Here we are June 12th and I still have not received a credit.  I've continued to call customer service and still receive dead ends.  My tactic of trying to place a new order no longer works as well.

Not able to speak to customer service on the phone to order, not able to contact anyone on-line to order, and unable to pickup anything at the store because they're backed up and cannot handle the volume.  Here's an idea- stay open for pickups at your store for more than a few hours a day if you're that busy.  I can't believe this company can stay in business with such poor leadership.  They won't get my business again."

I was charged the amount and now IKEA is unreachable.  This is a terrible customer service store, I understand most stores are shut down, however, phone calls are answered at other stores.  I am never going to shop here again!!!  I can't get a hold of anyone to find out what is going on.  So frustrated.  Stores are open, and I could have just gone to pick it up myself.  Was charged delivery and the product.  When I go to track my order, IKEA's website says order not found.  As far as they can see it was delivered.  Was not and would love to receive my bookshelf!!!"

If I physically go to the warehouse and waste multiple employees' time and my own time waiting for the order to be ready for pickup, then it's for free.But if I waste noone's time and order the items online for pickup in an IKEA warehouse, then I have to pay extra?Where is the logic? How does it cost IKEA more that a customer orders and pays for the order online and then picks it up when the order is ready, rather than going there physically and having an employee order the item from the back shelves and then waiting in line?You could use these fees to make more effective use of your employees' time. No rather, it should be opposite: It should cost NOTHING to order a pickup form the IKEA website, but there should be a fee to order it in the warehouse. Both with Covid-19, but also generally, customers ought to be nudged into using self-service at ikea.com instead of wasting your own employees' precious time."

  "articleTitle": "Careless",
  "articleText": "Bought a lovely lounge from Ikea yesterday from the As-Is section. There was damage on the underside but I was still happy with lounge and the discounted price, even after paying $69 fordelivery and an extra $25 for wrapping. The plastic bubble wrapping seemed perfect as the lounge would be stored under a carport for five days then transported for 90 minutes to its new home in the back of a Ute. I arrived from work this afternoon to find the lounge had been delivered completely unwrapped. The delivery guy knew nothing about it (he’s just a contractor) when my mother asked him why it wasn’t wrapped. I phoned IKEA with the given reference number and was on the phone for exactly 30 minutes, on hold for most of this time. The call centre guy spoke with IKEA and said that they could offer a refund and the mistake probably happened because they are very busy. Not good enough. Put on more staff- there are so many people wanting a job. He said someone would call me within the next 48 hours.Unbelievable. Wrapping is part of their policy if the item is not boxed! The docket would show I paid for wrapping. I am on my way home from my second shift and am holding my breath, hoping there is no damage when I check it tomorrow. Moving is stressful enough without this carelessness."

Till this day I have only received half my order and FedEx just notified me that they have lost my second package and for me to contact you all so you all can file a claim. How can I contact you all when you don’t even answer phone calls nor answer emails. I have emailed your Customer Relations department and issues with them are the same as with your regular customer service department. This is very unprofessional and displays a more serious showing that you all need to focus more on your customer service and response time with the customers that pays your checks. I feel like leading a protest against IKEA and tell everyone to shop Wayfair since they have exceptional customer service along with competitive pricing and they also care about their customers because they realize without the customer they are nothing. You, IKEA on the other hand have gotten too big for your own good and now need a reality check! Get my order straight for I have waited long enough and you do not have to worry about me shopping with you all again."

I was placing a large order which I received an order number for but no confirmation email. I spoke with Josh on webchat who advised that he couldn't find my order. I asked why I had an order number had been created if no order had been placed, which he was also unable to advise me on.I asked that since they had caused many problems with my delivery date and the move into my new property, could they change the date of the second order to the original date I was given. They advised that I shouldn't place a second order in case the first one actually goes through. I advised Josh that this won't be an issue as the second order can be refused under the unsolicited goods act or canceled as per the consumer rights act. He wasn’t able to help me with this wish is an appalling display of customer service, since this causes me major issues with my move.I requested that I receive a copy of our chat (which I wasn't given the opportunity to do afterward) which was refused to do. He made a claim with their resolutions team and as per my rights, I requested a copy of this too, which he refused and then proceeded to send me some text that he had typed up but no copy of the claim. As mentioned above, I will be filing a complaint with the information commissioner today as I understand my GDPR rights have been breached."

Tried to make a homedelivery with the postal service but they wouldn't.Contacted IKEA again and then they told me since home delivery couldnt be made I should call them.So I called them and explained the situatioin for the third time and got offered a small gift card. Gift card at IKEA wont pay for the time wasted talking to their costumer service, gas for the car, road toll and parking to get the second half of my already delayed package.Usually been happy with IKEA but when you have to jump through hoops and in the end just recieve a useless gift card for something they messed up."

I have sent emails, requested call backs and joined web- chats all to no avail. The kitchen remains in my garage in boxes unable to be completed until I can resolve this.

Kitchen installation finally happening (pandemic delays due to social distancing). I need two more cupboard doors and extra toe kick due to plan modification. Soonest delivery by truck was 1+ month out. Bit the bullet and ordered, then canceled immediately and placed partial order (no toe kick) to qualify for parcel delivery, which showed arriving within a week. My card has been charged for both orders. The order that was supposed to arrive on June 1 hasn't even shipped as of June 3. Cannot get a response to cancellation emails. After trying phone customer service for three days, finally reached a human who put me on hold and never came back (waited for a half hour). I love IKEAs products, but I will never buy IKEA again. Shocking that such a large international retailer is so utterly ill-equipped. Even on a good pre-pandemic day IKEA's prehistoric website functionality and \"Where's Waldo?\" customer service make it hard to spend your money at IKEA. Now, they apparently think it's OK to take your money but not actually provide the product. Up next: filing a dispute with Amex and the BBB."

  "articleTitle": "Worst Experience Ever! If you value your money, do not shop there.",
  "articleText": "If you don't want to have money taken from you for a month, don't shop there. Ikea borrows your money for a month and returns it to you, with 0% interest, only after you wait hours to talk to them and ask for a refund. Zero respect for customers, absolutely horrendous customer service! I will NEVER shop there again.I placed an order on 29 April 2020 and got an email saying that it would be delivered 3 days later. 2 days later I get an SMS saying \"your order will be delivered tomorrow between 7am and 11am\". The following day at 2pm, nothing had arrived. I get in touch with Ikea through their web chat. They say the order will come. Still nothing.The following day I request a call back, and 30min later a man with an unintelligible accent rings me. He says my order didn't come because one item was not available. (But they couldn't have let me know the day before, of course not! Why let me know if they can make me sit and wait all day like a moron?). He then reschedules my order for the 25th of May - yes, 3 weeks later, and Ikea refunds me for that item 4 days later.On the 20th of May I get an email saying that my order had been cancelled. No explanation, no excuses, nothing. Just - your order has been cancelled. I try to get in touch with them but the buttons for the web chat and call back are inactive. Their website randomly activates these buttons, so you have to keep refreshing every 5 min until you hit lucky. I was finally able to request a call back on the 27th of May. They rang me and - surprise! - I pick up and they stay silent, then hang up on me. Hours later I was able to request another call back, and this time a lady rings me and I am able to explain the problem. She then says I will get my refund within 7 days and they would send me an SMS confirming that the refund had been authorised. I had to check the amount, because they were not refunding the delivery charge!! If I hadn't told them that I wanted the 49 euro back as well, they wouldn't have refunded me for it.So I have two tips:1) If you are thinking of shopping there, think again. We were able to buy everything we wanted from other shops and get everything delivered within 1 week after all this Ikea nonsense. Ikea basically borrowed our money for a month.2) If you have done the same mistake I have and are trying to get in touch with them but having difficulties, I have found a loop hole on their website. Using Safari on a Mac (I don't know whether this works for other browsers), you keep refreshing the contact page until you see the button for a call back activated. After you request a call back, simply hit \"back\" on your browser, and you will go again to the page where you can enter your phone number to request another call back. So no more refreshing-for-hours-like-an-idiot, just ask for another call back if they take more than say 20min to ring -- or if they hang up on you."

They took my payment, however they have been completely unreachable to inquire the status of my order. I was on the phone for over 2 hours Without being able to communicate with a rep.  As one of the biggest companies in the world I am incredibly disappointed with how they have handled their online orders during COVID-19. It’s clear they weren’t equipped to handle this as other companies adjusted quickly. I had no issue with Structube. Received my sofa within 3 weeks of ordering."

I've always had a good experience at IKEA buying directly from the store. This is the first and last time I will ever buy anything online.BEWARE: Don't buy anything from IKEA online right now. The delivery delays mean you won't get your package for at least 8 weeks (usually much longer) and their phone system is always down so it's difficult to reach anyone."

  "articleText": "Ordered on April 26th 2020 with estimated delivery on May 13th 2020. No communication from IKEA before that except the initial purchase confirmation. Somehow managed to get through the phone support to a customer care operator and got the following explanation: some of the items were out of stock on the delivery date, but now they are back in stock, so I should expect a notification they are out of the warehouse for delivery soon. No clarification on when the \"soon\" is: days, weeks, months... I did not receive any update from them and opened a dispute with my credit card company effective May 28th 2020. Got an update from IKEA with new delivery notification on May 31 2020.Without any transparency from their side and with close to ZERO possibility of reaching the customer support my intuition says that they don't want to go through their backlog trying to serve current customers first.First of all it would be MUCH better if IKEA charged you only when items are ready to be shipped. Considering the current situation I would not mind waiting much longer for the stuff to be delivered if they would have communicated it clearly. Instead I feel like I was just lending money to a multi-billion for-profit corporation for an unknown time without any interest rate and zero accountability from their side."

WHO decides this could not be done, the CEO, really? AND WHY?  Does he decide these operational details?  Or is it the tech programmers?  WHO and WHY does a global IKEA get bogged down with these minor details that would benefit itself AND the customers.  If you're in the business of selling, WHY do you create senseless obstacles to the sales. I'm not an economist, just a customer with some common sense.Also I wonder if these reviews are for the pleasure of other customers OR does anyone at IKEA management reads them!!! So if IKEA does read them, I would like a reply."

Now with this pandemic, your true colors are coming thru. NO EXCUSE FOR NOT HAVING CUSTOMER SERVICE.  All other stores have had GREAT customer service and pick up ...

  "articleText": "I placed my order with Ikea on 4/18/20 understanding that COVID-19 has vastly effect e-commerce. To be honest, I'd be fine with the delay if I didn't notice other retailers basically continuing business as usual. I ordered from another retailer and after reaching out they told me that delays in France where manufacturing has been halted was the reason for the delay which I fully understand. Ikea has closed down all of its communication with customers. I understand furloughing people, but I am certain this kind of work can be done from home -- responding to customers over email. Or better yet, a single mass email to all open orders explaining the situation. Instead, I waited 6 weeks before I got an update -- that my order had shipped. However, it's been 5 days since that email, and FedEx's portal says the label has been created but not sent out... WHY?!? Post memorial day, it should be shipped by now (Wednesday). All routes on the phone (1,2,3, etc) lead to being disconnected, the only kind of response you can submit online is to cancel your order, and that's been the experience thus far. All I ordered were some aluminum shelving for my cabinets and a pack of tea towels... I didn't even order large furniture. If I didn't already have some of those shelves I'd replace them with the container store which although delayed got my order to me in 4 weeks. This is the last time I'm ever buying anything from Ikea because it clearly isn't supporting jobs and the experience itself is as low quality as the goods they sell."

Well i have done so.  trying  immediately after midnight or 4 a.m. or 10 a.m. or 2 p.m.   i have been doing this every day over a week. there is never any time in which there is availability of ordering. NEVER!   what a scam why have people going through the whole ordering process  and then rejected?/ take the orders and then fill them when available. i dont care if i have to wait a week or two. Ikea you wasted A LOT of my valuable time on earth for nothing. please fix this system  the current one is very rude. i am suprised by a formerly excellent company in all aspects."

  "articleText": "More then once now, I have tried to order a couple of items from the IKEA website. After I get all the way to the payment It finally tells me I can't order because they don't have any available and tell me to \"try Again Later\".Why don't tell me it was not available when I was looking at the item like other stores do? Why can't it just place my order \"on back order\"? why do I have to try again_ waste my time_ instead of them filling my order when available? -- Not efficient. Not convenient.OK a week later I tried again. It had my items available. I placed the order. I was excited to finally finish my home office.... Well....hold your excitement!!~!! Because 1 week before I was to received my items -- it was canceled. \"It simply canceled the order period. no explanation,. was not available\" . Here is you money back and try again later!!!  AGAIN! here goes more of my time--- Not Convenient!!! Also the other items were delayed 10 days!!!Now, I learned that I can order and pick it up at the local store in Colorado. I was all excited. I read I could order, pay and it would schedule a pick up for me.I can see they have my item but again only when i get to the payment part of the process it is telling me that the \"Location I need....  exceeded the amount of orders\" TRY TOMORROW. What is wrong with these people???Why can't you just fill my order and let me know when it is available to pick up??? like it said it would?? why is this so inconvenient???So I called.... and I get a machine who tells me \"Sorry but we are overwhelmed and can't take you call!\" Is this for real????My understanding is that IKEA is an European store and I can't believe that Europeans would put up with this bad of a service.Please fix it. There are plenty of e commerce websites who do a fantastic job at websites and delivery. Ordering through the internet is not a \"new thing\".I like your store but after I am done with my two items I might never purchase from you guys again. I feel a total lack of appreciation for my time and money."

So I called customer service, waited on hold for literally 3 hours, got someone on the phone to check what happened and after giving them my order number, they put me back on hold for another 45 minutes and disconnected the phone! I called again, waited another 2 hours and the person who answered just automatically hung up!! I can't get ahold of anyone, Ive called continuously throughout the day and no one is willing to help. IKEA and their customer service line is absolute trash. I understand there is a pandemic, but the absolute lack and refusal to help their customers is just maddening. I still do not have a resolution to my issue, no furniture and no refund."

After 30 calls I finally get through and then I'm on hold for almost an hour. They tell me they are processing the order.Cut to today. I decided to check the order manually and find out its been canceled. That was 2 hours ago. Still no email to tell me it has been canceled. I spent a hour and a half on the phone to find out why. I'm livid. I can drive 1.5 hours to a store that has click and collect but no matter what time I try to make the order it tells me that the quota for the day is full. Even at 4:30 this morning when I tried to make the order just incase. Apparently ikea doesn't have a phone number for the store either. What a terrible experience. Over a month and they refuse to do anything to help. Just keep taking our money and acting like we are the problem.Avoid at all costs"

Returning is so easy if you change your mind in 365 days wow but I wouldn't leave it that long and I never needed to return anythink anyway. I'm happy with what I brought.

After not finding our curtains we reached out on the phone to the customer service that was not available, because of technical difficulties, overwhelmed line (another customer was also Missing parts og their order, when we were still there).Later we have been able to get in the line, but after a long waiting we decided to leave our phonenumber to call us back. We have been called back that day and the very helpful assistent let us know that actually the curtains were not on stock in your warehouse?!We dont understand how this can happen, why no one has been notified us... She helpully assured us that the curtains Will be sent and will arrive to our home address on the 17th of May. We have reached out yesterday again, waited 1 hour in the phone queu, when finally the assistent told us that the Missing part of the order have been shipped but we were only going to get a number today ( working with a webshop I am aware, that at the moment of preparing and dispatching the package, a waybill number is generates, so I assume the package has not been sent...)Today we were still patient ( now it has been almost a month since we have ordered)  but no sign of any tracking number or confirmation of shipping.We wrote everything down in their customer service chat telling all we got was false promises and what we got there in return was a general promise again.. finally after we've been sturdy, they asked for our bank account to refund the cost of the Collection, THE CHAT CLOSED DOWN!!! After the chat has been closed we couldnt get back to it again.We are very dissapointed, never would have thought that we are going to be treated this unprofessional by IKEA........."

They are in fact TAKING orders online and TAKING money online, but they are not fulfilling those orders. The last email I received was on April 16th and they took full payment on that day, unlike other retailers that do not charge until your order ships. When I tried to call customer service to get a status on the delivery, I was not able to reach a human being, although I did spend a lot of time going round and round with an automated call menu. Worse yet, the only option they have for contact us on their site gives me only one drop down selection - \"Order Cancellation\", but the form that should show text fields for me to populate order number and other info does not populate. I tried tweeting. No answer. I tried Facebook Messenger. No response. So here I sit... products and customer service both missing in action. The delivery day - 30 days from date of purchase - has passed. Now I have to dispute the charges with my bank and explain to them how I was \"flim-flammed\" by a \"major retail chain\"."

How is this legal and how is this allowed in the United States. This company is sheltering millions of dollars on the shoulders of its customers just to whether its own economic storm. I have called this company 25 times in the past three weeks, and have never gotten a live representative. This has nothing to do with call volume, otherwise the odds of one person getting through over dozens of calls would be at the least possible. In fact, this company has no interest in talking to customers.  I was a two-decade consumer of this company, but no more. This is corporate disrespect at its highest level: take the people's money and do not look back. Even Amazon has automated chat response. Even EBay will take a phone call. IKEA: nothing."

Ikea sent an email saying my item was on its way, the delivery company said they had no knowledge of my delivery. Ikea have no way of being contacted, no email, no online chat and certainly no number. So I have paid for my item, waited more than three weeks and now for all I know I may never receive my item and never be able to contact Ikea. So what do I have to do? Hire a solicitor and Take them to a small claims court to get my money back? No one has time for that. I feel that many companies are using the Covid 19 pandemic as an excuse for bad service. All it takes is for Ikea to pay some staff working from home to answer questions. But they are too cheap and only concerned about their profits which they seem not allow Covid 19 to interfere with."

  "articleTitle": "IKEA customer service is NON-EXISTANT",
  "articleText": "I think everyone knows by now that we're in a very complex situation and companies are under a ton of pressure to fulfill orders and meet demand....yet somehow every other company I've ordered from online has been able to meet some kind of service standard. IKEA is clearly just letting all its customers down from what I'm seeing. I mean first off, maybe you need to give customers a heads up when they order that they will be waiting 6+ weeks for delivery and maybe don't charge customers until you actually fill the order. IKEA's customer service right now, is NON-EXISTANT. Chat always full- can't even get in the queue and the call centre just disconnects you after you've been waiting. Maybe they need to re-evaluate the order system instead of just piling on the orders and back-logging their warehouse. They're just racking up the orders so they collect as much money as possible before their entire system crashes. Good job."

  "articleText": "We placed our order 4/2/20 and were given a delivery date of 5/5/20. Our delivery date passed with no call OR updates about the products. On 5/11/20 we received an update saying the items never left the warehouse and it would be delivered 5/13/20. Our delivery time came and passed on this date and when we call, their outsourced delivery call center let us know that it was now delayed until 5/15/20. Today, our items were finally out for delivery and then during our scheduled delivery time the order was cancelled. Ikea emailed us for the first time stating the delivery was cancelled due to broken or missing items. Our new delivery date is 5/26/20, but I am sure there will be more delays as it seems to be common. Ikea's call center is overloaded and impossible to get through, they simply hang up. It may be due to the virus but we are very unhappy with how things were handled by Ikea and NAL (distributor). We will not order from them again."

  "articleText": "In March, I ordered a sofa and a few other items and was given a delivery date of mid-April. Come mid-April, the delivery came, only to receive HALF of a couch. Since the couch is modular, the half of a couch I do have is missing legs on one side and has metal connectors visible. Terrible and dangerous! But that's not all. After countless promises for call-backs and warehouse searches, no one ever followed up. Finally I was able to get a supervisor, who offered to refund the delivery fee and the part of the couch that wasn't delivered. Like that was making it right... I was told I could order it once it came back into stock. So I did (after getting the refund 3 weeks later). I ordered the couch, which said it would be delivered in a week. Four days later, after I called to double-check, they said my order was cancelled (no email/update online). Why? Because Ikea didn't receive my payment. Even though my bank account showed that had been pulled (the full delivery and all). After checking with a manager, they found out my CC was charged and that it was cancelled due to a \"technical glitch\". Kicker is, the couch is now out of stock! So I'll get a refund in 3 weeks and still half a couch! I will never ever shop at Ikea again. There is no sense of customer service at this company and their order system clearly doesn't work. Ikea never offered to make it right and none of the representatives/managers ever offered to make the situation right or follow up"

Requested a call back, and was provided with a case number and additional phone number to call. Called and was very abruptly advised 'it will be handled', the 'customer service' rep then hung up. One week later, no refund or update so I called again to be advised my case number is invalid... I'm now waiting on a new case number and told I'll be advised via email on 13MAY20. I'm not hopeful of getting the refund of 300euro+ any time soon. DO NOT ORDER ONLINE FROM IKEA - order elsewhere or wait until the stores reopen and you have your goods in-hand.Update 14MAY20 - promise of an email and next steps on the refund was yet another empty promise.

  "articleText": "While I would not call going into the store to make purchases a bad experience, ordering from them online is not a good option. I have had 3 online delivery orders with them and one for in-store pick up. They deliver things open and unprotected, which the delivery people have even called crazy. The in-store pickup has some policies that are not consumer friendly. The main reason I'm writing this though is the 3rd online order from them, which will be my last. I ordered from them on April 11th for a May 11th delivery date. one item was out of stock, which they notified me about on May 8th. What they did not say is they canceled the order as a result and created a new one without a delivery date. The order was not showing up on the website so I called them. They offered a delivery on June 28th. I declined and they said they would have the refund to me in about 10 days (most place do a 2-3 maximum). Every other company I have worked with makes a point to make things right quickly. Offering a delivery over 6 weeks later after you have already waited 4 weeks is by no means reasonable, at least to me and my experience in customer service."

  "articleText": "Ordered items, paid extortionate delivery cost and chose date of delivery. As all the reviews, my delivery also did not show up. As all Ikea phone lines are closed, i had to wait on a chat portal, which in total wasted nearly 6 hours of my time. 1st individual i spoke to Muhammed.Hadn't a clue what day of the week it was.Asked when my parcel would arrive, he left the conversation.Waited again to speak to someone. This time it was someone called Katie.She advised it should be delivered and gave me a telephone number to call. I called the number whilst chatting to her, and the recorded message stated we are unable to support you through this channel. Basically meaning the phone lines are closed, which is what it states on their website. When i advised Katie of this, she stated, the phone line is open and it stops taking calls because too many people are in the queue. What a lie. When pushed for confirmation of delivery and the complaints process and details, again she also ended the chat and left.Finally spoke to 3rd joker called Janet. Who again could not give a straight answer when i asked if she could provide me with the tracking number of my order. I stated, the ikea online tracker is inaccurate. She stated DPD are having tech issues, therefore their info is not coming through to ikea and they do not have any details. But she was able to confirm, the item is loaded on the truck and assured me if an item is loaded then this means it will be delivered on the day. I spoke to DPD, who can search if they have an item for you by name and address, confirmed they have no delivery or tech issues.You've guessed it, No Delivery and no apology or call or email to advise of delays from ikea. If you can't operate during this lockdown, then stop trading. Letting so many people down who are keeping themselves occupied by renovating/decorating their home and using ikea the Not So Wonderful Everyday! to do this. I have emailed their complaints team but no response. Even that on their website is hidden really well, you have to search like a mi6 agent to get those details. But here it is if anyone needs it: ikea.complaints.gb @ikea.comDon't bother ordering online. Even though they are rumoured to be opening soon, just spend your money elsewhere."

I called up to see what had happened and turns out the number was wrong on the order so the delivery company had called and because no one had answered, they just didn't turn up. Okay maybe fair enough, so I asked them to update the phone number on the order to my number and rescheduled the delivery for 8th May. Due to some system error, the delivery company didn't get the message, so again it didn't turn up. I then spoke to another person and arranged delivery directly with the delivery service for 11/05. I didn't get a call with a four hour window the day before so I call up today and turns out they called the wrong number AGAIN and cancelled the delivery because no one answered. Now the IKEA number to reschedule the order isn't working. Totally pathetic! Very frustrated an will definitely not be recommending to a friend."

Read their instagram, there are people waiting for 8-10 weeks. All those money are in IKEA's hands now, and yet they accept new orders. This isn't just unethical, this is criminal. No one should be allowed to collect money for goods/services they don't intend to deliver.I understand the pandemic is affecting retailers all over the world, but every single retailer (from amazon to small local businesses) I dealt with in the past two months has been able to deliver the goods, albeit later than usual.

  "articleTitle": "Shocking service recovery",
  "articleText": "My girlfriend made an online order for us. She drove out to the IKEA Taastrup where we ordered from and was told our order had been cancelled, recreated and cancelled again (I suspect a member of staff didn't fancy picking so many items) my partner asked how this was possible as the only information she had received was an order confirmation and instructions for us to go and collect our order.She came home empty handed. After chatting to web chat she was instructed to call customer services. Customer services told her after a lengthy call that they had agreed for our order to be picked with the store and we could collect it after the next day. We have a newborn baby and were in the middle of moving so our time is limited and we were counting quite heavily on getting the curtains from our order to help put the baby down to sleep in the dark.We also specifically chose online picking to avoid crowds (due to the virus) and to save time.Next it was my turn. I drove again to IKEA early on Sunday morning to collect our order and made sure I arrived early enough (09:40) to be the 2nd car waiting outside the collection point.IKEA staff came strolling out of the building around 10:15 and began dealing with the first car at least 20 mins after the supposed opening time. When it was my turn I was asked to wait in bay 1. I did so and after 10 minutes I was told very quickly through my car window that I needed to go to the returns section of the store to collect my order, and they had nothing to do with it (even though 10 minutes earlier they took the code customer services gave to my gf for our newly recreated order). At this point I was beginning to get very frustrated, it was weekend and the number of cars in the parking lot indicated there would be a lengthy queue.The returns section was cordoned off due to the virus and I could see that only 1 or 2 people were being allowed down into the returns section at a time. I explained to the member of staff on the door my situation. This was the only member of staff of the 10 that I, or my partner dealt with who showed any real empathy to my story and situation. He let me go down, avoiding a queue that looked like it would take at least 45 minutes to get through.Downstairs I spent 30-40 minutes with an angry, uninformative member of staff who made phone call after phone call. Always out of hearing distance for me and who told me multiple times \"it's busy\"\"you will have to pick your order yourself\" \"I don't know where your order is\". It was quite clear once I was asked to leave the collection point that my order had never been picked.When you pay for a service you expect it to be delivered and if not at least a satisfactory answer to why what should be a standard business practice of order picking could go so wrong. If you're staff had any proper training then a simple apology, explanation of the error and some form of compensation would have kept me a happy customer. Instead her and others lack of empathy and desire to take responsibility to do this only fuelled my frustration more. I can see now that I am not the only one who has received such a shocking level of service so it is clear IKEAs promise to pick and deliver orders for such a low fee clearly backfired and fatigue set in for staff.In the end I got a refund for the exact amount of our order, so I could go and pick my order myself and a measly 300 kr compensation for 2 wasted car trips and approx 8 hours of our time split over multiple days wasted not being able to collect the order as intended.Terrible service execution and even worse service recovery."

  "articleText": "I placed an order for on 10th May worth over £400. IKEA emailed me on 8th April to tell because they could one item (a plant pot worth £10) was not available, they have refunded my £10 and changed my delivery date to 30th May. What is the sense in that? I checked the item online on the day I received the email about the delayed delivery and the item was actually available for delivery in my postcode. Yet, when I called their customer service, I was told that whoever was responsible for organising my items for delivery could not find the plant pot even if it says that it is available online. This is an absolute disgrace and probably the last time I will be buying any Ikea items!"

In a normal world that fine, but during COVID they should make changes to their procedures to honor their own terms and conditions with the customer. They put the onus on the customer to keep the broken furniture until IKEA feels its okay to pick it up.They don't really care about following their own rules; their customer service agents just makeup stuff and try to placate you with tiny discounts.

Everything is ready to go, we just aren't allowed to buy.-  Call them up next day, wait in line for over 50 minutes (all the while being told it's almost your turn and they value your time...).- Told that we have book another design your wardrobe meeting, you generally have to book well in advance to get one of these.- In next meeting, we're told that you have to book with your local advisor, otherwise they cannot send you your wares. We have to book yet another meeting.- We are now told they can't deliver for 12 days and some of the wares won't be available until 5 days from now. Unfortunately these won't be part of the order. Lots of confusion as to how many people we should be to receive the wares, since they apparently wont deliver into your apartment and which warehouses will have then missing pieces stocked at what time.I strongly encourage everyone to pay a little extra, so you avoid spending weeks getting your actual wares, several trips to the physical store, and not the least - get nicer looking furniture."

I have tried since 2018 and in 2020 had to just get a new mattress from someone else. I have proof that some of my attempts to contact them through the channel they recommended (using the online contact form) did reach them, as I have the \"No reply\" confirmation email telling me that they will get back to me. They never ever did get back to me. Their tactic with warranty claims seems to be to ignore until the customer goes away. I find it disgusting that they would bait customers with long warranties (25 years is the longest I've heard of for mattresses) and then just completely ignore their warranty duties. Anyone else having this issue with IKEA? If there are enough of us suffering this, perhaps we can get a class action suit against IKEA."

  "articleText": "Our bad experience with Ikea started pre coronavirus when they sent us the wrong item we had ordered online. We arranged for it to be collected and the right one delivered, however on the morning the delivery was due we had a phone call cancelling it due to the coronavirus measures.When I checked online it said they were still delivering and indeed they were tweeting people to say they were still fulfilling orders - clearly not the case! When I finally managed to get hold of someone they said my item had been cancelled because it wasn’t an online order. Of course it was an online order as I’d ordered it from the website, however apparently exchanges need to be done via a store.So even though it was their mistake in the first place they were unable to assist and said that the only option would be to wait until lockdown was over and they could deliver the correct item.This wasn’t acceptable to me, I needed the item for a nursery, there was no good them exchanging in a couple of months time when the baby is already here, meanwhile having space taken ho with the incorrect item.After a lot of arguing they agreed they would refund me the difference between the two items and I could just keep the original incorrect item. This wasn’t great as I’d already paid the extortionate £40 for delivery of the wrong item, but it seemed like that was the best we would get.Of course surprise surprise the money has never actually materialised. I was assured it would be refunded within two weeks. After three weeks I got in touch again and got told it was stuck in a queue but would be processed in 3-5 days. Fast forward another week, still no money. Get in touch again and told it would be another 3-5 days. Surprise surprise 3-5 days later and still no money!!! They have now messaged me on Twitter asking me to ring them so they can manually process the refund - god knows how long it will take to get through and again I probably still won’t actually receive the money.I appreciate companies are under pressure with coronavirus but it is still not acceptable to just keep hold of someone’s money when you are not able to deliver them the goods. Ironically I could quite easily order the correct item online and pay another £40 for delivery, yet they won’t deliver the correct item to me as they say they can’t currently collect the incorrect one. Little more than thieves!"

I waited 1 full month for my order for it to not arrive on the set date and then for it to be cancelled without my permission. Had to wait another 20 minutes to talk to another analyst to try revoke this cancellation to be told that they can do this but the 3 main items I ordered were now out of stock and delivery will not be until mid June for the other items so I had to keep my refund as the order was pointless.

  "articleTitle": "IKEA - Feels Like a Scam",
  "articleText": "LONG STORY SHORT:IKEA took my money over two weeks ago, failed to provide the product I paid for, and made it near impossible for me to get my money back. If I wasn't dealing with a large, established, and \"respectable\" company such as IKEA, I would feel like this was an attempted scam.DETAILS:This is the first time I have ever felt compelled to leave an online review for anything. The Customer Service experience I have just had is absolutely appalling. I am disgusted that a corporation as massive and profitable as IKEA are so wiling to screw their customers. I made an order on April 3rd. It is now over two weeks later and my order has not been delivered. When I check the status, it tells me my order is still in the \"Picking\" phase at the store. It has been in this status for the past two weeks.So I decided to just cancel my order as I really can't afford to wait so long for something that has become an urgent necessity for me. However, when I called the store, the number was \"currently unavailable\". When I tried to use the online form, it would freeze and not allow me to submit. When I tried to use the online chat, it would tell me it was not available.I finally managed to get through on chat today. I waited maybe 15 minutes in the \"queue\" which is completely understandable. However, when I did get through, the agent told me that it would take \"7-12 business days\" to issue a refund due to delays caused by COVID-19. I can certainly understand how COVID-19 might affect certain aspect of IKEA's operations (such as store opening hours and even delivery times), but I'm really at a loss to understand how issuing a refund would be affected. I mean, is this not an automated process? Do IKEA's staff physically go to the bank for cash and hand deliver my refund? If processing my payment isn't affected by COVID-19, then returning my money shouldn't be either.In any case, I really had no choice but to accept the 7-12 business days for a refund and so asked the agent to proceed with cancelling my order. He then informed me that he would need to transfer me to his after sales team. He did so and I was alerted that I was number 1 in the queue and wait time was 5 minutes - fantastic! Except I was waiting as #1 in queue with a wait time of 5 minutes for 50 minutes. At a certain point the chat just timed out due to \"user inactivity\". So now I'm back at square one.Undeterred, I begin a new chat. Again, I get through to an agent fairly quickly. But she also tells me that she needs to transfer me to the after sales team to process the cancellation and refund. I plead with her not to, but she clearly has no other recourse and so I am again transferred. Once again I am #1 in queue with a wait time of 5 minutes... and I have been that way for an hour.I have now lost all hope of ever speaking to the mysterious after sales team who alone in all of IKEA have the authority to process a cancellation. I finally managed to use the online form to send an \"email\" request. Apparently, they will get back to me within 96 and 120 hours. Perhaps they will, but I am not hopeful.Since writing the above and after an hour of waiting, I have finally managed to get through to an after sales agent on the chat. She informed me that my cancellation was processed and my refund would be issued within 5-10 business days. This is considerably less than the 7-12 business days the first agent told me about. Was his intention to discourage me from cancelling? Is this the company policy?At this point, it goes without saying that I will never shop at IKEA again. COVID-19 has affected most businesses, but if the local shops in my area can set up online delivery platforms that are effective and fast within a matter of days, then IKEA, with its massive resources and infrastructure, should be able to process a simple order cancellation."

She scheduled a callback for the when I was at work, although I told her that I will be unable, for that I can lose my job.I talked to the callback agent, who made me be very late for work, her telling me that they can deliver the items on the 15th of April, after me repeating for the 5th time that I am not available. She asked me when I will be available again, I told her that on the 18th and that it's URGENT. She didn't care about this and her reply was simple and very sarcastic: 'I will reschedule your delivery for the day you will be available all day long'. I told her that I want to make a complaint and in a rude way she told me to do it on the website.On the 15th of April I received an email saying that was order was successfully delivered. I NEVER EVER RECEIVED ANYTHING FROM THEM. So just to make sure, with my last hope, I opened a chat to make clear that my delivery wasn't shipped to a different person. I waited 15-20 minutes on the queue until the 'lovely' Beatriz answered me. I told her my issue which ended up with her closing the chat. I opened another chat, very angry for that and guess what! I caught our 'lovely' Beatriz again. I asked her to transfer me to a supervisor or to a different agent and tried to lie to me that she can't do that and that all of their chats were fallen and I told her to check the previous chat which happened 5 minutes ago if she wants to be helpful. When she refused I wanted to send her a screenshot from the so called previous 'chat' with her, to realize that she closed the chat again. When I wanted to open another chat, I saw that the chat button was not available anymore. Why? Because their customer service is open until 8 PM. Guess what! It was 8:03 PM but it was 7:36 PM when I opened the chat the first time. I sent another complaint and I know that I won't receive an answer again.I would attach the screenshots of the chats to show everybody what 'great' customer service means. This will follow up with a complaint at the complaints book so that the authorities are aware of how the customers are getting screwed up and stolen by these kind of companies."

  "articleText": "If I could give zero stars I would.I placed an order for a loft bed and mattress almost a month ago. On the first of delivery attempt the drivers gave me one box out of the three items that I ordered. Two boxes that belong to an us another customer and was told that I was supposed to get three boxes here is three boxes if they’re not correct we can’t take them back you have to call customer service. That was three weeks ago I have had another customers order sitting in my house for three weeks my daughter who is five years old has been without a bed for three weeks waiting on this to be delivered. I am now being told that to the mattress that I had ordered and paid for is now out of stock which it wasn’t when I ordered it. The delivery company keeps trying to deliver the frame itself or to pick up the other customers order no attempts to get my order correct have been made. IKEAs customer service has been incredibly awful to say the least. They seem to be more prone to just throw money at the situation instead of trying to fix it. I don’t need money thrown out the situation I need my order I’m at the point where I’m going to just cancel my order in order with somebody else. If you have the option to order with anybody other than IKEA do it worst experience ever will not be shopping with them again"

The day I placed my order I received a message saying my order was being handpicked. Then nothing..... When I contacted Ikea today 17 days later, all I get is 'sorry, fed-ex is behind'. I can understand that, but what I do not comprehend is how I can be told Ikea has no idea when it will be delivered. April, May, June? My order is still with the store. Ikea's shipping fees are some of the highest in the industry, yet there is no accountability for giving me any information as to an estimated delivery date on their part. Ikea you need to negotiate a better delivery contract. You need to lower your delivery fees, especially in an age when Amazon does much faster and for free. You need to up your game if you wish to stay in the long run. And, you need to better equip your employees with information so that they can communicate effectively with the customer."

I was VERY much looking forward to it. I selected the wrong color and called customer service immediately after I placed the order. I was told they can't cancel it but that I could return it for the other after it was delivered. Weird and annoying, but far from a deal breaker.First , I'm told it's out for delivery. Then they I get a call (at the end of the delivery window) that their truck broke down.I call Select Express directly and they schedule for next Thursday. Seven days later, (a week lost) because they say they only deliver to my area on that day. Thursday comes.  I call that day, I get confirmation on delivery. They transfer me to their IKEA specialist, who hangs up on me. I call back, the specialist laughs at me and blames IKEA for \"choosing the wrong date\" when I called them directly. I call IKEA and they say they will refund for shipping for this horrible experience. That works for me, I am happy. They schedule for Monday.The tracking number showed they loaded it at 10:30 AM on the truck for delivery. I follow the truck on the map on the Select Express tracking. It starts to get late. The map no longer loads. I call Select Express and they say they lost my couch in their warehouse and that they will call me when they find it. Even though it shows as being loaded on the truck. I call IKEA who calls Select Express, who tells IKEA \"we never got the couch from you\". A slightly different story.I call IKEA. The first option is a full refund and a cancellation of the couch I really want. I go for it. Obviously its not possible to get this couch.I message IKEA on Twitter, I'm told that my refund is in the \"final stages\" of being processed. I get refunded for the shipping. I message again. Nothing for several days until finally I'm told a glitch has caused them to only refund my shipping. I can expect the rest in the next few days.How could I possibly ever recommend IKEA to anyone when I can't even get one sofa with my first experience with IKEA. I am so disappointed that I cannot get that amazing couch. I can't shop with IKEA ever again and will recommend others to do the same.I asked IKEA if they would offer anything to maybe convince me to buy the couch (small discount at least) and prove that they aren't all bad. They offered me free shipping HAHAHA. Goodbye IKEA. Hello Wayfair...."

  "articleText": "With the news about the furniture lawsuit in the papers about faulty dressers, it may be helpful to revive Ikea's value. Mistakes happen, and its how a company reacts to make the change.--Ikea is focusing on the value its products bring to their consumers, not with just an affordable pricing structure. They've precisely pinpointed their cost structure in the sweet-spots of wallets. And to supplement that pricing, they give consumers a community to belong to with their open floorplans and a unique buying experience. It almost gives me a vision as to what a success story looks like, with seeing open housing concepts and being able to capture my own independence when I buy a home or condo, and begin to liven it up; just by walking around. Ikea supplies just that right amount of \"gunpowder\" to make an idea explode into action. Cheap, but not discount store quality. What other furnishing company can pull that off?"

  "articleText": "Ikea Taufkirchen (München Deutschland)If it is possible to give even lower score, I'd gladly give it. Today I was waiting for 3,5 hours (I came at 9:50AM and went out from IKEA at 3PM)  just to change 2 small things on already pre-designed kitchen. They keep you waiting for more then 3 hours due to their complete incompetence as how they say: they have no personnel who speaks English.., so instead of informing people like me about that, they keep letting other people to design their own kitchen while (English speakers, wait in the IKEA like morons). More disturbing part was, that I was speaking with them in English and they have replied without any problem. While people were waiting to be served, personnel were having fun, fooling around,  laughing, joking and acting totally unprofessional and inadequate. On top of that, when you request to speak with whoever is in charge at that department, some of their personnel are completely dishonest saying that they mentioned that this takes more then two hours, while to me they claimed it is \"up to 2 hours\" (huge difference)... To IKEA folk: Do you really think that wasting 3.5 hours of customers time is a normal thing..., shifting our plans and agendas, while in parallel you don't even consider that it is important to inform people prior,t  you have issues with your own personnel/man power, and/or that you cannot serve English speaking folk? If you do, then my question to you is, what is wrong with you people?"

  "articleTitle": "Avoid this toxic company who hold their customers in contempt",
  "articleText": "IKEA Manchester overcharged us by £21.00. I only discovered this once we got home. I called customer service and was told we'd have to return to the store within 14 days to get a refund and that they'd have to check the CCTV. This was not welcome news as it meant a 1-hour round trip on a work evening which was highly inconvenient. I couldn't believe that they didn't have a better and more sophisticated system in place than looking on CCTV. Despite the frustration, we turned up to the store yesterday evening only to be told that they didn't gave any staff available to check the CCTV so couldn't issue a refund! I was furious and demanded to see the manager. The manager was devoid of any charm or pleasantness and told me it was their policy to check cctv first and that I wouldn't get a refund until the next day. We were given a case number and told we woukd receive a call once the refund was done. I made my frustration known and said I intended to complain. The manager looked totally unconcerned, and reading comments here I can see why. They basically couldn't care less because no one's going to do anything or take any action. I checked their website for their complaints procedure and there isn't even a complaints category included as far as I could see. Again, another clear signal of just how little they care about their customers. After searching via Google I found an email address for Javier Quinones at IKEA and emailed about my situation. Not even an automated response came back telling me how long before I'd receive a reply. By 2.40 pm today, no one had called back so I contacted customer service again. After almost 40 minutes on the phone of stalling and being put on hold for ages several times, I put my foot down and finally got to speak to the manager. I was told he'd contact the store to get them to resolve it but there were all sorts of excuses given for their useless response. I told him I expected the refund to be sorted within the next hour as it was their error and I'd spent so long trying to get this resolved. I tweeted about their useless service on IKEA Support and got a quick public response asking me to DM them. I did this but they did nothing in response except give me another pointless reason for why they couldn't sort it out. So, merely a face-saving exercise in public, which is sheer hypocrisy. We are still awaiting the refund so the only route for us now is via our credit card company. I see that IKEA don't bother to respond to any of the many complaints on here which again just shows their contempt for their customers. With all their millions of profit, they still refuse to give us our £21 back that they took in error. It beggars belief. Truly, I never want to deal with this vile organisation again. It's a toxic company staffed by management who couldn't care less. Avoid at all costs if you want to keep your sanity and money."

(the other end legs went up wobbeling up/down) i have contact immediatly ikea via facebook... noone giva a s.h!..t about it, i called ikea phone , noone can not help, contact ikea many other times via facebook msg... every time diferent people was replaying and instead of help , their was bouncing the „ ball” to the other „ colleagues” ... i was tired of that sh!t, finally after sending many pictures of the problem, talking to at least 8 diferent people.. one operator , ^ Lisa, said their  will send me 2 „experts” to my home, with a new bed and new piece that had broken eco- leathet. Ok i was waiting 2 days with no contact, when it happens,all my living room was a Mess because i couldnt put it together this as as i dont use defected products! Aventually after 2 days 2 „ experts” came to me... their cross my door step and look at the unfolded bed and said..” is it from ikea”??? , w.t.f ... no, from media markt... yes i said its ikea, vimle, kind of popular model... the „experts” first time have seen a bed from ikea... i had to show them how to open it, how to close it, their was looking on manual 20 minutes, their was touching the joints like it was a rocket science.. finally their said „ we dont know why its like this” one said , that i can put 2 books under this hanging in the air legs...! WT£I said no! Lisa said, you are comming here, and u bring a new bed and new back rest , where is it? ...yyy, „we dont know nothing about it..” we dont have it.. i immediatly called ikea, i was on the phone 20 minutes and the girl couldnt do anything, she said basicly, its ikea Breda, you have to contact them, i can only arrange exchange for next week!i said NO, i ve been told by Lisa, their will brong me pieces TODAY, as im waiting to use this couche since ive paid for it 1.200e already 9 days to be able to sleep on it or use it, i want this today! Noone couldnt do anything, i was left with this rommel alone... writing to ikea on messenger, was like .. one operator asking again for my order number, then another operator also ask me to fill some form, then another one is totally not aware of nothing. I wasted tons of my time, energy, nerves for nothing. Then their said the „ experts said their couldnt judge the problrm cause the couche was not fully assembly by me! It does not matter! The bed mechanism works the same when is assembled or not, the danage on ecoleather wont heal itself when  I MEAN W.TF PEOPLE, is it some joke? Ikea sell you SH! T and  wash hands, noone can help u, noone can do anything. U just left with a bunch of „collegues” who just reflecting the problem one to the other making a jerk out of you. And noone is responsible. Their lie to u, their misslead You like Lisa did to me. And thats it. You waist your 2 weeks of your precious time for this . I paid 1.200e for the couche, im ashamed i didnt go to any other shop, could buy much better couche, much better design,much higher quality, and for product for 1.200e some help if needed or some respect. Also the back rest pillows of the couch has a huge diference in hardness... one pillow is around 1.5x thicker/harder / more dens, than 2 others which makes it not comfortable thete where is a “hard” pillow. Judge yourself if u wanna go tru all this problems."

I get an email from IKEA saying they want us to pay $50 more to deliver it. Why are they charging me twice for a service they never provided? I called ikea support, and they said that apparently nobody will come to deliver the items unless you answer a call from an unknown number a couple hours beforehand. I never answer calls from unknown numbers. It should be illegal to charge people for services you did not provide. I will not be paying for redelivery, and ikea is refusing to refund the $50 I already paid for delivery. Unfortunately, I paid with a debit card, so there is no way to dispute the transaction.

You have to be careful with the furniture as it can easily get scratched and of course because it’s made of wood splinters you can’t expect it to last for 10 years. But who knows if you take really good care of it, maybe you’ll be surprised. So far I am happy with my products and I didn’t have any bad experiences with them. I usually go there and buy them myself, but when I bought the bed, mattress and wardrobe I had to choose for them to be delivered. The guys were really nice and the furniture was in perfect condition. (I also have mirrors on the wardrobe and they came intact)"

  "articleText": "We bought the PAX wardrobe set and a mirror weeks ago and opted for home delivery.  On the day it was meant to arrive, the delivery was towards the end of the window they gave us (we received no notice until they were almost at our door and thought they had missed our order). Some items were delivered damaged, including a smashed mirror and a broken PAX frame. The frame was \"dented\" in the sense that the laminate tore and the inside looked completely hollow. The delivery guy said our items were at the bottom of the truck, so that combined with it being late implied we were the last delivery of the day. They made a note of the damaged items and told us to wait for a call from IKEA. (A somewhat odd note was they refused to take the smashed mirror back, and just propped it against a wall by the kitchen, even though we had a cat who could get himself hurt with the exposed pieces.)The call never came and several days later we decided to call IKEA ourselves. They don't tell you the wait-time would take hours.

  "articleText": "We bought the PAX wardrobe set and a mirror weeks ago and opted for home delivery.  On the day it was meant to arrive, the delivery was towards the end of the window they gave us (we received no notice until they were almost at our door and thought they had missed our order). Some items were delivered damaged, including a smashed mirror and a broken PAX frame. The frame was \"dented\" in the sense that the laminate tore and the inside looked completely hollow. The delivery guy said our items were at the bottom of the truck, so that combined with it being late implied we were the last delivery of the day. They made a note of the damaged items and told us to wait for a call from IKEA. (A somewhat odd note was they refused to take the smashed mirror back, and just propped it against a wall by the kitchen, even though we had a cat who could get himself hurt with the exposed pieces.)The call never came and several days later we decided to call IKEA ourselves. They don't tell you the wait-time would take hours. The agent told us they were low on stock and would have to call us back on Wednesday (which is a week later).That call never came either, and on Thursday we called IKEA again, got put on hold for hours, only to be told by the agent that our case needs to be transferred to the after-sales department, which is unavailable currently due to \"high call volumes\".We called once again on Friday, got put on hold again, got told by an agent again that he'd need to transfer us to the after-sales department, to which by the way there's no direct line, so you have to remain connected through two transfers and two queues or else your enquiries won't even reach a human being.So after waiting another several hours and 29 other callers ahead of us, we got hold of an agent who, to add insult to injury, tried to offer us 20% discount to keep the broken wardrobe.

I had my builder take out my old kitchen and then booked him to install the IKEA kitchen based on their promised delivery date.But IKEA repeatedly rescheduled my kitchen delivery, each time only telling me so on the day itself. This delay cost the builder three days of lost work, for which he invoiced me £600.I told IKEA this and they invited me to send them his invoice indicating that they do offer reimbursements. But while they accepted the legitimacy of the builder's company, his tax status, and of the claim, they refused to pay the invoice on the grounds that his company is not VAT registered - a factor which is of course irrelevant to the claim. It is of course perfectly legitimate for a company not to be VAT registered, but IKEA tell me it is against their own regulations.So I am left with a bill for £600 from my builder for lost time through no fault of my own, which IKEA refuses to refund on a technicality of their own invention (nothing to do with UK consumer law) which I cannot get around."

  "articleText": "So IKEA has this 365 days return right? complete scam... this is just to attract customers to their shop and screw them up later. I purchased a the Vemile sofa from Ikea, 4 seater. After about 150 days, when i was returning it since it was very uncomfortable and for its extremely low/bad quality,  i called the customer service and asked if i can return back the sofa, stating that I used it for 150 days, I don't have the original package since the return was not planned, and that if i can get refund to the original method of payment, my CC they said yes. so i rented a truck and disassembled the sofa, and took it there to be faced with these scammers. IKEA customer service kept me holding and arguing with them for 4 hours 6:00pm till 10:00pm and be faced with these scammers on the counter that didn't want to return the sofa. why? because they said its used and i don't have the original packaging stating that they only take it if it is with the packaging to \"PUT BACK ON SHELF & SELL IT TO OTHER PEOLE\". Customer service on the phone says something which is not inline with the store customer service. IKEA staff has misunderstanding between them, this shouldn't be reflected on the customers.3 issues here:1. customer service on the phone says one thing, Customer service in store says another and argue with you and their manager just disappears for not wanting to Meet the customer, which she was employed to deal with.2. IKEA wants to put the furniture back on the shelf?? really?? then did i buy a used sofa before and paid the full price of it? are they selling used furniture with the price of a new one?3. 365 days return policy!! hahahahahahahha tell this to someone that has no common sense. there will always be something that you will pull off not to return.If anyone has a sense of mind, don't go to IKEA to buy anything. they will only make you lose your money and its value."

The back board wasn’t much stronger than cardboard and the rest was very poor quality.When i phoned I got a very rude customer service manager who basically told us we had built it wrong. Not sure how she could know that with no evidence at all. I then spoke to someone else over email who looked at pictures and said we had built it wrong. He said this is a very common problem with this wardrobe and therefore he knew we had built it wrong. Problem: if this is a regular problem perhaps maybe there is an issue with this wardrobe?? however they refuse to give us a refund! I will never buy another thing from IKEA. I am absolutely disgusted! My problem with this is that IKEA are a massive corporation and I am me! Customers should not feel like this. I wouldn’t recommend them to anyone."

  "articleTitle": "IKEA.se scammed me into paying double delivery fee, then hijacked the furniture I already paid for",
  "articleText": "I ordered furniture for +8000 SEK for my house in Sweden from Ikea.se. The order was scheduled for delivery today. Nobody called me about the delivery and hours later I got an email saying the delivery could not be done and to call customer service.From customer service I learned that - according to IKEA - the delivery driver had tried to call me once and I had not picked up. And they cancelled the delivery. If want a new delivery, I had to pay for deliver again.First of all, I did not receive this call, despite the fact that Ikea confirmed that my number was correct. I was literally waiting for the phone to call and I can see in my call history that NO ONE tried to call me.And now the very rude customer service representative requires me to pay again. I told her that wasn't fair since I didn't get the phone call and everything was ready for delivery. She finally told me that I wouldn't get delivery without paying for it again. And hung up on me without rescheduling another delivery, thus effectively hijacking my paid for furniture until I pay up.Now I have the option to either 1) NOT get the furniture I've already paid for, or 2) pay double fee for delivery, without any guarantee that I'll actually get my furniture - because, as I learned from the customer representative, if the driver can't reach me again, they'll also cancel the second delivery. And so on.I'm very surprised anyone choses to run a business this way in this day and age. The customer representative thought she was very generous and said Ikea could perhaps pay half the delivery fee, but it's not about the money, it's about what's right and fair. And so far, I've already paid 8000 SEK for nothing."

I ordered a sofa and phoned to check whether the delivery service would bring it into my flat and the room of my choice. I was reassured by the IKEA representative that they would climb the external staircase to my flat, so I paid extra for the delivery service. The delivery men refused to carry it up the stairs to my flat (even with my help). After a fuss, they left all 7 boxes outside at the bottom and disappeared. I was left to carry all the boxes up the stairs on my own (including the heavy big boxes weighing 42kgs). After two hours managed to somehow lift it to the top. Once in, I was putting my sofa together and found 4 sofa legs were missing from the pack. I reported it to customer service, who said they would send it in 7-10 days. So now I have to wait another week and a half until I can fix it and sit on my sofa properly."

However when I did complain to Transport services complaints their answer was that there was no damage to the items they delivered so basically who cares that we muddied your carpet. Therefore I would be weary of the delivery services they employ and also I think that the complaints dept is redundant as I complained and nothing was done.

I spent £127 and had to return £30 Kingsize bed slats I purchased for an ikea kingsize bed, because they didn’t fit (hasten to add it’s the second set I’ve purchased as the current set, also bought from ikea, don’t fit and fall off every night).  I only got £25.28 back ! So not only have I still spent £97 - I’ve only received £16.72 discount from the promised £20 and still don’t have a bed fit for purpose ~ spoke to customer service and they didn’t really care or offer compensation ~ just suggested I waste a bit more petrol by returning to the store and buying another set 20 cm wider that probably won’t fit and will then also need to be returned and a bit more petrol wasted. I had wanted to return a very expensive cutlery tray (£27) as it has chipped 1st time cutlery was put in it (the wooden looking ones - don’t buy!) but if I do that, once again I won’t get full refund - I’ll lose another £4.25 !  I also have Pax wardrobes drawers - they have faded in different shades so now look striped - another item you shouldn’t purchase is the large hemnes drawers as there is no support underneath and unit bows in middle.

It's badly or not at all treated and already has water damage, the cover strip is coming off due to it and it's constantly damp as it absorbs all the water.As the solid wood worktop has 25 years warranty I contacted Ikea to have a recplacement worktop or refund.They informed a third party technician needs to come by for an inspection. And there is no other way. This inspector only comes one a month to Ireland  and I was expected to wait a month. Which I finally hadTo accept. When I called to confirm this, the technician wasn't available anymore and they don't have a replacement available nor an idea of when they come by.I thought surely Ikea would sort something out, but Nothing! I keepBeing referred to their policyAnd expected to wait!!!I actually don't know what to do as the damage is getting worse everyday, my kitchen is looking horrible and no idea if/ when someone might help.Don't buy a kitchen here!!!!!"

  "articleText": "Very disappointed with the customer service. A price tag on a display item showed a discount. I assumed this discount applies to this product, but was wrong. It appeared that the discounted was only this one particular item.When I spoke with a customer service person in store, I learned that I should have \"looked at other same products to confirm the discount\" and \"asked a stuff member to give me this item from display, so I could use the discount\". What an utter nonsense??Lesson: be careful, when you see a discounted product, make sure the discount indeed applies; otherwise you may find yourself as surprised as I did."

  "articleTitle": "Very unhappy with their customer service",
  "articleText": "With my first order, everything went well. Delivery in time, good quality items for a good price. So I ordered something else. Shouldn't have done that... I paid over £100, delivery was promised for last Sunday. No delivery, just a message from the delivery company about a delay, with an update promised within 24 hours. No update. I raised an issue, the delivery company promised an investigation, since the parcel had kind of disappeared, result due within 3-5 working days, communicated to the sender, not me. But I was at least promised an 'initial update' within 24 hours. Then I contacted Ikea. They told me I just had to wait. I wanted to cancel the order, but was told this wasn't possible anymore since the items had been sent. Today, no 'initial update', nothing from Ikea either. They just leave me dangling. A good customer service would mean they either send the items again immediately, with me having to promise to send the first parcel back, in case it appeared again miraculously, and them sorting out the problem with the delivery company which, after all, they have chosen, or cancelling the order with a full refund. Instead, I have to wait a week, with no idea what will happen after that. I freely admit that I am a bit spoilt, being so impatient. But a customer-friendly company today simply delivers when promised or tries their utmost to remedy the situation if this does not happen and not just lets their customers wait. I have come to expect such a good service since most companies with online business offer it. Not Ikea, though. This will probably have been my last order with them, whatever happens with this package.P.S. I finally got Ikea to send a replacement. But, lo and behold - the next day the lost parcel was obviously found again and finally delivered, after a short additional delay. DPD apologized repeatedly for the delay, Ikea didn't. So even the fact that the package finally arrived does not merit more than one additional star. The customer service could have been a lot better."

I ordered some other things with it and the delivery service brought the smaller things but not the table. I then re-scheduled it for my next day off, the following Saturday, when it did arrive. Then Christmas happened, so the next available Saturday, I was ready to put it together. However, it was completely damaged on every corner. I called customer services who said that they would send somebody to get it, on the next Saturday. I gave up 4 Saturdays for a table that I couldn't put up! No compensation offer, nothing.

  "articleTitle": "UPDATE:  IKEA came through!",
  "articleText": "Ikea is great to shop for affordable furniture and their furniture is durable.  I own a few pieces and have recommended some to friends.  When my son and daughter-in-law were visiting over Thanksgiving I took them to the Columbus, OH store where they purchased a table top and 4 table legs.  They were moving to a new apartment in January - 6 hours away in Michigan.  When they moved in to their apartment, they attempted to assemble their table but one of the legs had a manufacturing defect and would not thread.  We called the Columbus store and at first were told that we could return the $4.00 leg and get a replacement.  My son explained they were 6 hours away from where they purchased it.  He was told there was a store in Canton MI, but of course that was a mere 4 hours away. It would be highly inconvenient for them to make the 4 hour trip for a $4.00 leg, could they please send a new one?  He said he was willing to pay for a new leg, he just didn't want to pay the shipping.  I could return the defective one if necessary when I returned to Ohio.  The CS representative told him she could not do that, so he asked for a supervisor.  After some discussion, the supervisor appeared to understand the dilemma and appeared to want to help.  He said he would send one out, he said he would send a shipping notice to my sons email when it was shipped, etc.  When I first wrote this review I gave IKEA a one star because after all the talk, my son didn't receive a notification or anything and I really didn't think IKEA was going to send the leg, but I was on my way back to OH and my daughter-in-law called and said the leg had come!   Thanks, IKEA.  You came through!  I can fully recommend even distance travelers!"

  "articleTitle": "IKEA two sofas and a rather uncaring attitutde",
  "articleText": "We had two order numbers to buy a sofa from IKEA and had all kinds of problems.  After we bought the 1st order on a \"click and collect\" basis, we went to the store to pick it up and found out that it had been cancelled by a staff member. We finally got the refund on November 28 after spending countless calls and time waiting on the IKEA customer service line. Since the store is far away from us we had to return home to order (we could not reorder at IKEA) it online. We arranged for delivery to our house. On the day of delivery, the driver did not have an important piece with him.  For the inconvenience, we were given a $30 gift card (which we don't even want to use at this point). As we tried to assemble the sofa, we discovered that the pieces were completely wrong so the sofa had to be returned.  The shipping charges were waived. While I was building the replacement sofa however, I was using the IKEA wrench that came with the sofa and due to a small sliver of metal that was protruding I badly cut my finger. It took me quite some time to staunch the bleeding. IKEA was quite concerned and when they called back to get the lot no. of the wrench, I had to lift the sofa (alone) from one side to the other until I finally found the number that they sought. You would think that they would have appreciated that but no.  They offered (another) gift certificate which I refused saying that after injuring myself, helping them discover this production issue and having to move a heavy sofa alone, I would have expected more. Thereafter I was called by an IKEA manager saying that they did not credit any money for injury because there was \"no loss of money in a transaction\". I found this to be rather surprising.  I was close to having to get stitches and after all of the time spent on the phone trying to call (they must have asked me to call back about 10 times with average wait times of 45 minutes), cutting myself and trying to help them by locating required information, I was astonished. I would have expected more.   But alas, IKEA has changed."

  "articleText": "Bought the Hemnes 6 drawer. Product bowed and drawers did not shut after 1 or 2 weeks. The product has a inherent design flaw and if you actually read up on the product nearly 100% of people experience this. It has no supporting leg at the front in the middle so it naturally just dips under its own weight. Ikea had someone come inspect it to make sure it was a manufacturing fault and not our fault, upon walking into the room he laughed \"oh not another one of these, I don't even need to ask where the problem is\". Ikea should not be selling this, and despite having concrete feedback from their inspection, they are making it VERY hard to organise a refund. We have to disassemble this large, heavy unit with no instructions and zero damage so that it can be returned to them. Considering these things are designed to not come apart after they are built... talk about bad customer service. This returns policy means we are essentially stuck with the product and cannot get our money back."

  "articleTitle": "BEWARE OF THEIR SHADY BUSINESS PRACTICE!",
  "articleText": "BEWARE - IKEA removes bad review for their products from their website citing \"policy violation\" and refuses to explain which exactly policy does it violation when you talk to their customer service. This practice is as bad as quality of their products. So I'll post my experience with their product here for everyone to read.I know IKEA makes cheap furniture, I do not expect much believe me. But I was horrified how degraded IKEA quality over the years. I have a bookcase that I have purchased from IKEA about 10 years ago and it's a solid piece of wood, it's heavy constructed, still holding up fine. I wanted to replace it with two of these bookcases thinking that I'll be getting similar build level. I was so wrong. I guess IKEA cut all possible corners in 10 years to make it as cheap as it can be to manufacture. It's so flimsy and unstable, the sides are not solid pieces but just a frame with think inserts. The bookcase is constructed in a such way that it can not be put flush against a wall if you have baseboard because the read \"legs\" do not have a cutout for it. Quality of woodwork is horrible - it's uneven, unrefined and plain bad. Two of my side boards are not even glued properly and sliding back and forth in slots. I'm not going to talk about the design because it's non-existent. Paint is as cheap as everything else and while it's called dark-brown it's in reality simply black probably for the purpose of hiding bad wood quality. I will repeat again, I was extremely disappointed when I have unpacked the bookcase, this whole thing just screams in your face - CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP. Now I'm not sure if it's worth wasting my time to try to put it together or I can just throw it away immediately. I wouldn't complain if it would cost you $50 but for $150 this is just a robbery in a daylight. I will never recommend to anyone to buy anything in IKEA from now on, IKEA quality went too downhill in the last years."

They've sent us the plan which didn't include the whole kitchen but a part of it (which also was done late). Later after contacting the planner she said she would send the whole plan the very next day but it has been weeks that there is no progress nor the design was sent. They have not replied to calls or mails. Such a poor service. Didn't expect such a bad service from them. Being a reputed brand shameful for having done this. This is not the reason we have paid 3k."

We purchased a medium mattress and were reassured by the staff who said that we had 365 days to return it if it wasn’t suitable.  We put the mattress in place however the  mattress is rock hard with a ridge in it. We telephoned customer services who said that the 365 day return policy did not apply to mattresses as stated online. We were not told this in store. We have been advised that we can only exchange it for an alternative however Ikea  acknowledge that the next mattress up isn’t  available in a single. When we said it was not the same as the in store model that we had trialled customer  services said that the store mattresses weren’t like the ones sold as people had tried them?? and  they advised us to sleep on it until it became comfortable. Our granddaughter is only four and weighs just over 2 stones therefore her altering the mattress would be an impossibility! The mattress has been removed and is standing in our hallway as we have no use for it. We tried to write this review on the Ikea Website however Ikea have censored the review and have prevented us from submitting it. We have wasted a significant amount of time and money and will not purchase from Ikea again.

You should treat your customers well if u want them to speak good about you and encourage others to come , in my case I’m going to tel others not to buy from you I had a much better experience with bobs furniture center they brought the item and built it without any charge I just have them money to be nice"

XPO made several mistakes in delivering our furniture and we spent multiple hours on the phone for days trying to rectify that. The XPO staff also refused to deliver large items to our apartment but instead dumped them in the lobby of the building. The building has a service elevator so delivery to a particular floor is not a problem.My advice would be to avoid deliveries from IKEA in NY City.

  "articleText": "Horrific, third party delivery company employed by IKEA. If you cant pick it up at the store and take it with you BEWARE! Let me just tell you that if you do not heed this advice and you trust them to deliver something to you in a manner that you will find pleasing and excellent....YOU ARE TAKING A HUGE RISK! I had to reschedule a delivery for some stand up mirrors (that I ordered online and spent over $500.00 + dollars for.  I was challenged by uncaring, incapable and at worse, ignorant service personnel at every turn. To be fair, the employees of the third party deliver service that IKEA contracts with in the San Diego County area were the ones that I would corral into the ignorant and uncaring category. However, some of the staff at IKEA's 800 number fell into this category as well. It got to a point where they were mad at me for being frustrated. As if I didn't have a right after 3 failed delivery attempts (and broken promises by them) and me taking 2 days off from work to be there to receive my product and no delivery people showing up....and not even having the courtesy to call me and tell me that they weren't coming? The service failures are so egregious it nearly borders on conspiracy theory material.To this day, I have still never received my shipment nor gotten a refund. I even responded to several of their automated follow up messages and gave them a 1 star.....I still never heard anything from whomever was supposed to be monitoring the customer review process! It defies logic.  I have never wished ill upon any company other than the perhaps say, the IRS. However, I do sadly hope that IKEA goes the way of the dodo bird and becomes extinct. This is because I truly feel they don't care about me/us enough to step up and listen when their clients are asking for their help.P.S. I noticed when looking for review sites for IKEA, that the independent review sites that IKEA does not control have VERY low scores from customers. However, IKEA's own client feedback site seems to contradict that with much higher aggregate reviews???? Um, who's review site do you trust? Pretty safe to say that the independent review sites like this one with an average customer review score of just over 2 is probably a lot closer to the truth. I hope this review has been helpful. Thank for taking the time to feel my pain. Trust me, I have much better things to do with my time :-( ARGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thanks for nothing IKEA"

  "articleText": "Ikea Germany: total disaster! Absolutely not recommend.I have been an Ikea's customer since late 90's. In general I have been always satisfied with their products - design, quality vs price, etc.I had never problems with Ikea in Poland and Denmark. Never.In Germany things look different.I had huge problem with delivery. Delivery was delayed - and it wasn't my fault. I took a day off, stayed home to be sure everything will go smoothly. Unfortunately it didn't.Finally, after 12 days since I completed and paid for my order, I got my furniture. Everything at once. In a small apartment.Top 3 problems with Ikea Germany that make my really angry:1. It is NOT POSSIBLE to contact Ikea's tel. customer service.I tried more than 20 times. Different days. Different hours.The line was continuously busy. The line is unattended and it's even not possible to wait in a queue. Automated \"support\" inform you the line is busy, recommends you visit Ikea.de website and disconnects you! So good luck.2. Customer service via email works extremely slowly. You have to wait minimum 24 hours for an answer. Minimum.3. It's very difficult to find someone who can help you in English, but let's say that's my problem. On the other hand, Ikea is a global company and they hire a lot of people who speak English.In Denmark it's not a problem.I am truly disappointed by Ikea.My attitude to the company has changed dramatically.I just have a feeling that Ikea Germany doesn't care so much about its customers.With Ikea everything is seems to be ok when you come to the store. Pick up your stuff, pay and leave.If you expect additional service prepare for problems and ignorance.That's all."

  "articleTitle": "Absolutely FUMING - Never, Ever, Ever Order from Ikea Online",
  "articleText": "Genuinely never had a worse retail experience in my life. This whole ordeal has been going on for about 3 weeks now. I made an online order of a mirror, a shoe rack, 4 glasses, a small ironing board and some reusable bags. Not one item was delivered in one piece or undamaged.For some reason my order was split into two deliveries. In the first was the mirror, which arrived completely smashed to pieces and my nice cream net bags and ironing board were covered in black dirt. The mirror was rescheduled for another delivery, fine. My other delivery with the shoe rack and glasses took a total of 2 weeks, 4 non-attempts to deliver by my driver (despite my partner staying home from work to take these deliveries in, the driver couldn't be bothered to ring the doorbell or call us). The delivery was finally made after 2 phone calls and 2 online chats (one with an insanely rude and unhelpful staff member called Matt - unbelievable, this guy should be sacked), but two of the glasses were smashed into tiny pieces and the shoe rack was really badly damaged (very deep scratches on top and one of the corners completely worn off). I called to complain last week, and was told the replacement delivery would be made today. I needed to change the delivery date so tried to call up, I was told to call DPD which cost me £6, even though I was told the replacement items would be delivered by Ikea themselves. I was told to just await my text concerning delivery and then I could make amends. There was also a possibility of it being delivered in the morning which would suit me but I was sent no text or email or anything concerning my delivery. I got onto the website chat service, was put into contact with who I think is the same rude Matt from before, who tells me they are actually out of stock and they were to re-access the stock and contact me on the 13th, two days from now.All of this wonderful delivery service cost me a whopping £39. I feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone with this entire experience. What on earth?? Please take my advice, and never order from Ikea online under any circumstance, it's not worth the stress or colossal amount of time you'll waste.UPDATE: I asked for a refund and I've only been refunded for the items and not the £39 delivery charge. I'm absolutely furious, never experienced anything close to this terrible experience before."

The wardrobe was nowhere to be found in the drawing we made. Further investigation showed that somehow an additional wardrobe was added outside the drawing area. Ikea agreed it was a technical bug that shouldn’t have happened but refused to help with picking up the additional wardrobe. It would cost me 800 to have them pick it up, which is equal to the price of the wardrobe. I am not able to return the product myself since the package is 220cm long and doesn’t fit in my car. IKEA’s customer service failed hard today. Acknowledging a problem but refusing the help out by offering a simple solution, to help their customer with a pick up.

After going round and round with IKEA WHIRLPOOL and getting nowhere on a replacement I stopped into the Frisco, TX store and spoke with Alan in the kitchen dept and explained what had happened. He directed me to returns where I spoke to Marty who called another guy named Jordon and we had the oven replaced by the following Monday.I am so thankful for these people at the store in Frisco and my new kitchen looks fabulous with all appliances exceeding my expectations (microwave, double oven and very quiet and nice dishwasher. Shout out to Esther at IKEA Frisco for helping us plan.Whirlpool on the other hand has the worst customer service I've ever experienced! If you have a problem with one of their appliances from IKEA I highly suggest you go to the IKEA store you bought your appliance from and get help from them.KathieCorinth, TX"

I called 6 times and they \"couldn't\" cancel the order for days. They waited until it shipped and now tell me it will take 7-14 days to get a refund. They charged my card when the order was placed, and it took them 5 days to ship it. Most online retailers charge you when they ship. So, they keep my money for 3-4 weeks from charge (order date) to refund. In addition to making it almost impossible for you to get customer service, to change an order, or to cancel an order.If they hold thousands or hundreds of dollar from customer like this, that sounds like a financial fraud."

I have  4 mangled PAX units and a Besta in my bedroom not attached to walls ( and I have an infant) for the last 3 1/2 weeks. If you have a problem you get sent to a different phone number or online for everything and you never get a person. Last night, I went to the planning center in Manhattan to ask about my pick up which I was emailed by someone would be today. The manager was kind enough to make a few calls and told me that my pick up had been rescheduled until Monday. He was emailing or texting with someone else. I was told they would take the damaged units as is if they fit  through the door. Today, at 4:30 I had an IKEA delivery person in front of my building for a pick up. I live in Manhattan you can’t just show up at buildings whenever you want. There are delivery hours and COIs. The pick up delivery/guy refused to take the units. Frustrated  I then took a cab back across town to speak with the manager who had sworn to me that no one was coming today when I went yesterday. Also, that I would not have to disassemble the units. If they fit through the door they would be taken.I will say, the delivery guy said that there had been a lot of complaints with IKEA recently. I do not doubt it. I think the people I encountered working there were very nice but the company is very big and there are HUGE management and communication issues."

BEWARE!We purchased a KALLAK desk online on 30/08/2019 at 20:47 through the store in Wednesbury-Birmingham and paid for delivery at the store because we were advised that it was not available for store purchase and collection.We were unsure whether it would be right for our house and asked the store representative if we could cancel it after payment.The store representative specified that if we were to notify in time before the order is processed then that's fine. I went and cancelled in store within 24 hours. Sounds simple!However, the store couldn't get the refund done because it was an online order. How bizzare! That's the first time I've come across an online refund that couldt be carried out immediately without the order being processed because of the order being placed online in the store. Anyway, the store representative then raised a case (Case ID 32201051) and notified me that it will be refunded in 5 Working days. For reassurance he gave me a contact number 020 3645 0000 to ring and track the refund.I rang IKEA explaining the situation and they made it clear that I would receive the refund in 5 working days. I've tracked my online credit card and there has been no refund, even my statement does not show it. Its been almost 1 Month!I keep ringing but can't get through. This is wasting my time and money.I would advise not purchasing from IKEA unless you are 100% sure with your purchase. Their service is terrible, even in store, the customer service is really bad, slow and poor.You may as well pay a bit more and go to a good furniture retailer without the hassle.Shame on you IKEA!"

You'd think that kind of money would make a business want to provide good customer service or at least SOME customer service.The online system is a joke. The chat says I am number 1 in line with 0 minutes wait, then makes me sit there for 15 minutes with no updates. After a rep finally joins the chat, they type like a drunk: missing letters and whole words, weiRd caPitaliZation, ignore every single question I ask, and are obviously working multiple customers at the same time so wait 5-10 minutes in between every tiny interaction. It took over 30 minutes to schedule one simple appointment!While waiting for the agent, I called the local store. After punching in endless options, they announced \"call volume is unusually high\" and hung up! Not even an option to leave my name and number for someone to call me back.By now I received the confirmation of my order but the time was wrong. I tried calling the customer service number on the order form twice only to have them hang up on me both times. I tried fixing it through chat but it said \"we are unavailable to chat with you at this time. Please try again during chat hours.\" (I WAS chatting during normal business hours). I did finally re-schedule via email only to receive a phone call on the day that the technician was waiting for me at the house at the wrong time.I also tried to pay using the link in the confirmation email only to be told that I both can't register for a new account because an account under my email already exists, and that I cannot do a password reset because an account under my email does NOT exist."

They were very rude and unhelpful, did not bother to even help find a solution. We have the sink (the sink with two basins - one smaller one larger) for only a year and it is already faulty! We hardly use this side of the sink and have been extremely careful with it. IKEA customer service did nothing for us despite their \"25 years guarantee\". I cannot stress enough how truly disappointed I am in their service. Has put me off for good. PLEASE BE CAREFUL when buying as they do not provide any help in case of faulty products. A total waste of my money - I have to repair on my own terms when I should not have to."

  "articleTitle": "2 days waiting for a truck that never came",
  "articleText": "IKEA : no company has ever treated me as poorly as Ikea has. I'm furnishing a new apartment, and I ordered several hundreds of dollars worth of items from Ikea's website. This was 3 weeks ago, and I still haven't received anything. I had a delivery scheduled for 09/08. I received a confirmation that the delivery would be made between 12 and 4pm, so I stayed home from work waiting for the delivery. It didn't arrive and no one bothered to let me know that it won't be happening (the online tracking system kept saying it's on the way), so I've wasted an entire day waiting for a truck that never came. The following day, after several hours on the phone later I have rescheduled the delivery for today, 09/14. The delivery never arrived, but the driver marked it as 'delivered' (someone at XPO told me in a matter-of-fact tone that drivers sometimes do that so that they can get paid without going through the trouble of actually making the delivery. I now took two days off of work and still have no clue what's going on. I've also spent easily over 5 hours on the phone with Ikea / XPO and I'm disgusted with the service I've received. The prevalent attitude seems to be 'not my problem'. I've had people hang up on me, managers promise to call me within an hour with an update (whether they learn something or not) and never actually call, all mixed with the usual 10-20 minutes on hold. Not one person knows where my order is and it seems like no one cares either. Ikea graciously offered to refund the 40 dollars I've paid for the delivery, valuing a day of my work at 20$. According to people in the resolution department Ikea has done nothing wrong and apparently doesn't care to make even the slightest gesture of making up for me losing two days of work, several hours on the phone, and an extra week of not even having kitchen utensils. I'm just glad I bought my bed and mattress on Amazon.com, if I had gone with IKEA I'd still be sleeping on the floor."

I hung up quick . Rang another customer service number and waited 15 minutes and asked about the malm drawers I bought that didn’t match the ones I bought last year.

I had informed that delivery had to be until 5pm because of condo rules and I saw the seller input on system. On the day before the deliver I was informed that it would be between 5pm and 9pm - what ???? I spent almost one hour with them on phone and it was \"solved\" - on the next day (delivery date) XPO - their logistic company – called me to confirm delivery between 5pm and 9pm.... I called Ikea again and was rescheduled to 2 days later between 9am and 1pm. Guess what ??? Today I received a call again from XPO saying that it would be between 1pm and 5pm !! Again they will do what they want to and it does not matter what was informed to the Customer. IKEA is not a serious company and this logistic company is even worst ! For me it is clear it is a mass. They are big, should invest more in system, logistic or whatever. Now the manager is supposed to called me back to see if they get to change it…  this was my last bought at IKEA"

Received confirmation text evening before confirming delivery was booked in. On the morning of delivery, received an email stating delivery cancelled. No reason, just \"delayed\" and was rescheduled for Mon 9th Sept. Rang them immediately to be told didn't have enough staff to get onto van. Re-arranged delivery for Saturday 7th September. This time we didn't receive a delivery confirmation, so we rang on Saturday morning to check the delivery time to be told it had been cancelled again!! This time the reason was because not all of our items were available at the one store! We were told Warrington had all of our items in stock, and delivery was re-booked once again for Monday 9th September (today). We received a delivery confirmation for between 7am and 1pm. Not ideal as my wife was on nights and would have to wait up once I went to work. 13:05, still no delivery, rang customer services to be told once again delivery was cancelled!!!!! ABSOLUTE SHAMBLES!!! This time because the trouser rails we had ordered that were in stock at the time were discontinued. We asked why had no one rang to tell us this to be told \"sorry we don't do that\".This is, without doubt, the single worst experience I have ever had shopping online, and for a company the size of IKEA, is a disgrace."

As frustrating as the situation is, sh!t happens, today, i expect a call, text or even an email to let me know what’s happening with my delivery... I hear nothing! So I call customer service again (another 40 mins on hold/call) to be told they need to rebook my delivery... earliest delivery date? another 7 days away (presumably from the backlog of other undelivered items, that went on a trip round London yesterday)! So far these jokers have stolen 9 hours of my life from me! If/When the new sofa arrives, it will be the last thing I ever buy from Ikea, which is presumably Swedish for NO CUSTOMER SERVICE!"

  "articleText": "My first visit to ikea after my friend recommended it to me to buy wardrobe was really disappointing and racist. I was waiting 15 minutes to get served and was told the woman was on break and to continue waiting. So I did, and then 15 minutes passed and another couple just came and waited in line at the wardrobe area. The woman finished her break and went straight to help the white couple. I informed her I was waiting for a while and was there before them and requested her to help me first as I was searching for her throughout the entire store, I even asked her coworkers where she was. The couple even knew I was there first and we’re more than happy for her to serve me first. So she did, although she was EXTREMELY rude and was not even helping me, instead she was rushing to get back to the couple because apparently they had an appointment. So I told her to go help them and to please return to assist me afterwards. She asked if they had an appointment and they did not. Instead, they had the exact same question as I did about the exact same lights. I was waiting at the same area as the couple and the woman and over heard her being the nicest person I have ever seen. Then when she was done with them, she turned to me and started yelling at me and telling me I was rude for requesting to be served first even though I was there first and the couple did NOT have an appointment with her. I was so baffled that she treated me the way she did all due to my hijab. She told me off and told me to wait where I was and sent me Isiah D. who was MORE than helpful and continued apologizing for the actions of this woman. I just do not understand why I was treated with such disrespect from this woman, and it was not isiahs job to apologize for her actions and hurtful words. Because of isiah’s help I was able to buy three thousand dollars worth of housing equipment. Although isiah was able to make my experience better, it was still extremely upsetting and racist the way I was treated and I will not be returning to IKEA. It’s upsetting to see that racism is still a huge issue in our world, especially in an area where you are a customer service representative and should be treating people with the upmost respect."

After a problem arose Ikea are now telling me I'm responsible for contacting the fitter even though all payment was made to Ikea. When you access their customer service website you have a choice of stores to contact, you then have several other choices to make regarding your issue but not matter which store or other choice you make the phone number will be the same which suggests the whole exercise is a pointless one. This will be my last Ikea Purchase."

They are inaccessible, and even when you finally can reach a person, they are unhelpful and often unresponsive.  I've had significant serious issues with deliveries, parts needed after the fact, and general questions, and in no instance have I gotten a satisfactory resolution to the issue.  It's really hard to buy their larger items, as I'm aways worried what will happen if I need some kind of help.  It's really a shame.For example...I’m trying to buy a somewhat custom drain/trap for an IKEA sink. You can’t. You actually have to buy the whole sink. Just for the drain/trap. True story."

  "articleText": "Almost 2 weeks ago I had a delivery of 4 Nordli chest of drawers. When putting the last one together, I discovered the back piece that holds everything together was missing all the holes,  so it wasn't possible to use it. I contacted IKEA, when I finally attempted an outdated browser and was able to complete the form. Actually got a quick response and was promised a replacement part. Sadly, they opted to use a courier for delivery and didn't pass on my phone number, so a week later they still hadn't delivered and I called IKEA. They didn't want to take responsibility,  and basically left it for me to sort out. I work. I'm not at home between 9am and 5pm. That's why my original delivery was on a Sunday. Several other calls to IKEA and an escalation to a supervisor who is yet to follow up, I finally received the replacement part. And you know what? All 4 corners are damaged! This is beyond ridiculous, and extremely poor customer service. Never again! I'd offer 0 stars if that was an option."

  "articleText": "Ugh. I used to love Ikea. Ordered furniture online from Ikea, had confirmed delivery date and 4 hour window from their logistics Co. XPO. No-call no-showed. I called Ikea the next day and after much back and forth between Ikea and XPO was told the XPO truck \"broke down\". Rescheduled for later in the week. Had a confirmed delivery date and 4 hour window. No-call no-showed. Another call into Ikea and XPO, no excuse given this time, just that they were \"unable to make the delivery ontime\". My reply was to ask them to ensure that the delivery would be made early the next morning, like any other company would do when they failed to fulfill a simple service. The best they could offer was redelivery in 3 days. Unacceptable, but what could I do, they were holding my furniture hostage at that point. Third confirmed delivery date, with 4 hour window. Again, no-call no show. This time we DROVE out to the local Ikea and tried to get an explanation, which they had none since it was \"in XPO's hands\". Later that night I got a robocall from XPO explaining that \"the truck broke down\". Was given a FOURTH confirmed delivery date with a 4 hour window. Again, a no-call no-show. Four wasted days waiting for a delivery that never arrived, with poor customer service from both Ikea and XPO to boot. We canceled the order with Ikea (we will miss shopping your store, but this online experience was just oh-so frustrating), placed an order with Wayfair for a nearly identical item that was delivered in two days via Fedex. 8 days later, still waiting for my refund from Ikea, I guess I'll dip my toes into the water and call customer service, AGAIN."

All panels arrived by Ikea's courier on the Friday and the 2 man assemble team arrived on the Monday.When they arrived, the senior assembler was angry that the panels weren't in the bedroom with all of the wrapping removed. When trying to explain that there was only a pregnant woman present at home when the courier delivered the panels and that there was no way she could've brought them upstairs, he didn't seem bothered and gave my partner attitude because 'she should've had this done before they arrived'. He had a poor attitude throughout the duration they were here. They came without a blueprint of any description of what we ordered. Expecting us to provide photos of what we ordered. This, in my opinion should be prepared by IKEA and provided to the assemble team as it was built using a virtual program in store. As there was no blueprint, they ended up building a wardrobe that was not in the arrangement which we agreed on in store.After paying 400 euro for labour I expected a better service."

We ordered 155 euros of stuff online to be delivered to our French home. We were told it would arrive in two parcels. Only one arrived (with 45 euros of purchases in). The postman said, that now 'he knew where we lived' the other parcel would arrive shortly. It didn't. We called IKEA helpline to complain. We had to wait more than 1 hour to be answered, and were told that they were aware the parcel hadn't been delivered but that it would 'come in a few days'. It didn't. We called again. Again we had to wait more than 1 hour for customer service to respond. They now said that the parcel was 'missing' and they would investigate, after which they would contact us and refund our money. They never contacted us and no parcel ever arrived. They have stolen 110 euros from us and wasted so much of our time. I have written a complaint email but they have not responded. We have informed the credit card company who are now looking into it. IKEA act in a negligent and criminal way. How can a company this size to that? Look at the difference with Amazon, who immediately sort issues when they arrive. IKEA's website also makes it extremely difficult to contact anyone or find telephone numbers."

  "articleText": "I never write reviews, but I had such a terrible experience with IKEA that wanted to make sure I share it. After moving in to our new place, we rushed to order a few items from IKEA online so that we get them asap. We had got several items from IKEA in store before, but this was our first online experience. And it was unbelievably unprofessional! After waiting for 8 days, the night before the expected delivery date we called customer service to make sure the order was arriving the next day. To our shock, it was cancelled! And we had not receive anything from IKEA in that regard! Even worse, the agent was so rude that she said it's not their job to let us know, we should had asked! I still don't know why the order was cancelled, apparently it had to do with the credit card, but cancelling without notice is extremely unprofessional! Our waste of time aside, we are now going to order similar items from Amazon, and get them in 2 days for free instead of 9 days for $40 of IKEA! In the past, Amazon agents have even compensated me a couple of times with 1 month free Prime because of delayed orders, and IKEA agent didn't even apologize for entirely cancelling my order!"

  "articleTitle": "No Delivery and No on the Spot Refund?",
  "articleText": "Until this week, was a great believer in Ikea, being a regular customer in Australia and Europe over years.  However a refusal of an immediate refund of around $140 for an online order that was not delivered by Toll as promised, has left me gobsmacked.I have cctv footage of the truck arriving and 2 different drivers on 2 different days putting a missed delivery card under my door without any attempt at ringing doorbell.  Ikea are stating the parcel shows as \"delivered\" by Toll.  I also rang Toll for the second time today and finally was put through to someone in Australia so I could raise a complaint and she said the parcel is sitting at Tullamarine.  I am very unhappy as my contract is with Ikea and not with Toll.  I said I had over 3 days attempted to manage this delivery on line and on phone with Toll and I was done. Asked Ikea to intervene and was told I had to go back to Toll.  I said I would no longer do that as I had no confidence in them and I would not waste another day hoping for someone to ring my doorbell.   So then I demanded a refund.  Seems I have to raise a dispute because Ikea will not guarantee a refund or when I will get it.  Lose a loyal customer over $140....and I have all the video evidence.So far spent more than 1 hour on phone with toll, 3 times on line managing delivery all with conflicting information, 2 calls to Ikea wasting at least another 2 hours.  Come on.  Put yourself in my shoes.  I only asked for a refund because your agent said they would not make arrangements with Toll on my behalf, I had to do it again.  This time I refused as I have no confidence in them.  Now I have a driver complaint raised with Toll and I hope to be able to submit my video evidence of the drivers not ringing my bell.  I have confirmed the parcel is on the Toll system as sitting at Tullamarine.  The Toll agent said that Ikea staff were reading their information wrongly to say the parcel was showing as delivered.  I told Toll the parcel would be returned to sender as I had no faith in their drivers to do the right thing.  Now I have to wait for Ikea to investigate and get around to giving me a refund of around $140.  Tomorrow I will waste more time on the phone with my bank, raising a disputed charge with them as well as now I no longer trust Ikea after sales service to put the customer first."

  "articleText": "First, I mistakenly ordered a sofa instead of the similar loveseat, and it was a nightmare to correct.  The automated delivery system is user-hostile, and it was WEEKS before the mess was straightened out.Second, I ordered a medicine cabinet.  Only when the cabinet was assembled did I discover the mirror on the door was cracked.  I tried 30-50 times to phone---always \"we are experiencing a higher than average\", and a disconnect.  Then, the online form was impossible to use (and I'm very computer-savvy---35 years writing software).   I even considered snail mail, but (of course) couldn't find a suitable address.My advice is to NEVER use IKEA.com to buy anything.  I'm guessing that going to the store might prove equally unpleasant."

No opportunity to leave a message - oh, but did direct me to go online - which of course I had already tried.  This wasn't once or twice, but at least five different times.  Finally my husband made the 1 hour trek to take the table back to our nearest store.  Today I receive an email saying my order was shipped and I had not placed an order.  I had to go through this same routine - fill out the on-line form to email and it wouldn't submit (I am computer proficient so didn't forget a required field).  I then tried to call and got the same message I'd received before.  Now I'm afraid I will have a new table delivered and have to return it all the way to the store as well - products good, customer service very bad!!"

We had waited in all day for the delivery and didn’t get notified that our delivery couldn’t be delivered that day as we payed 1 minute past 10pm! We had wait an hour on the phone to find out where our delivery was. They then explained they will deliver on the Wednesday (the following day) when they turned up with our product, there was only half of it there. They had left the other half behind. We explained there is 11 boxes missing to the drivers and said they will get the store to call us and re deliver the following day. We was then waiting for a call and didn’t get one so we had to wait another hour on the phone to ikea explaining our situation and it turns out the drivers had lied and said we received all our packages! They then said they will get it re delivered on the Sunday. Again we’ve been waiting all day and nothing turns up! They couldn’t get our products to us that day ... AGAIN! And said they will TRY to deliver on Tuesday! This is a joke. How on earth do they take your money plus £39 for delivery and mess everything up without any care in the world. This is disgusting ! Won’t be ordering again."

It happens often and we are expected to put trust in a new date.  Needless to say with guests arriving that day we were well and truly let down and Ikea would offer no customer service solution...very disappointing."

  "articleTitle": "Horrible online shopping experience",
  "articleText": "My husband ordered a bed worth over $600 online on 04 July  2019 at 10.26pm . He got confirmation that it would be delivered on 09 July 2019 by Fedex. The next day, 05 July, he called to cancel the order and it was all good with Ikea. Nevertheless, Fedex came and dumped the items outside our condo in Old Montreal  on the same day (09 July 2019) unsigned for and unguarded. My husband got home from work and saw the items outside and took them upstairs (to 4th floor without elevator. Mind you IKEA claims that they deliver without elevator up to 3rd floor). After this, our ordeal with Ikea began. Calls after calls, we spoke to several managers after 50 minutes wait on the phone on average to speak to someone in after sales. They'd promise someone would come the next day and no one would show. We even spoke to a manager who had the guts to suggest we put it in a car and drive it over to them even after I told him we didn't have a car and that we placed the order online and paid for delivery. He promised he'd arrange a truck himself to come and pick it up. Another day lost and nothing. So, at that stage we decided to call the bank and request that the payment made by credit card be reversed since Ikea was holding our money and refused to give us a refund. The bank initiated the reverse process and it was then that Ikea decided to come and collect their bed. They promised a $75 dollar voucher which we still haven't seen. The whole ordeal took 3 weeks to settle.We decided to give Ikea a second chance given their gesture of goodwill ($75 voucher) and ordered items worth over $500 online again. I paid for express delivery (next day). I got confirmation once the payment went through on IKEA.com that the items would be delivered today, 04 August between 9am and 1pm. I get two missed calls from Ikea at around 9.49am. I tried to call the number and couldn't get through to anyone so I called the 800 number. The guy could not find the order number I gave him, which I had received from Ikea.com (and I never got an email confirmation). Then he used my phone number and other verifications to find the order. It had a completely different number. He thought I had got it wrong but I told him I had made a screenshot of the confirmation and read it to him twice. Then he tells me that there must have been a mistake because  the order was made in-store. I was shocked. I never went to the store to make the order. He could not explain what happened. They have a glitch in their system and no one has the bleakest idea they did? It turns out my delivery was scheduled between 5pm and 9pm, therefore I had lost my morning, and now I was going to lose the entire afternoon/evening. So, I spent my entire Montreal Summer Sunday waiting for Ikea. Past 9pm, nothing! I call again and again. Wait time of course 30-50mins on average, only to be told that nobody knows why my order has not arrived so some delivery dept. person would call me on Monday. I guess I will have to reverse the payment again and they should do what they wish with their stuff!DO NOT SHOP ON IKEA.COM! YOU WILL NEVER GET WHAT YOU ORDERED!! AND THEY WILL NOT REFUND YOUR MONEY UNLESS YOU TAKE DRASTIC MEASURES!!!"

  "articleTitle": "Missing items .. no bed for baby . 4 day wait",
  "articleText": "So, I’ve got to say IKEA customer service is the worst I’ve ever encountered. Got the items delivered but after building the first item, the second (a wardrobe) had parts missing. Rang IKEA to ask them to arrange for delivery of the missing parts and got told I’d have to wait until Saturday! Now, because I needed to build the wardrobe before the bed (due to space in the room), this meant my 19 month old would have no bed until Saturday, and IKEA were quite happy with this. Not good enough, after going round in circles for over 30 mins I said I would drive to IKEA, about 100 mile round trip! IKEA could not guarantee to cover my fuel and refused to refund the delivery, they offered only a £10 voucher for me to spend in store! I refused this as got told I couldn’t have both voucher and fuel (if they agreed to cover this in-store). After going round in circles on the phone the call operator refused to pass the issue up the chain and to give me any details of where to complain to and ask for any type of refund. When in-store they agreed to cover fuel cost (not sure it covered the fuel but they have a basic rate per mile that is non-negotiable). Gets even better, as when leaving IKEA, I saw loads of vans and also hire vans that they could have used to deliver my goods that they didn’t pack. I have just finished building the items at 23.25 so at least my little girl has somewhere to sleep, not that IKEA could care! Going to post on all sites I know but hold little hope of getting any kind of apology or refund as they seem to have unlinked themselves from IKEA on trust pilot! They obviously enjoy taking your money but when things go wrong and they are at fault they cannot accept it and actually make it more stressful. Like I said, the worst customer care I’ve ever had. IKEA won’t be seeing any more of my money!"

  "articleTitle": "Order delayed for 14 days, no real solution given ...",
  "articleText": "I've been shopping with IKEA for a while but had a bad experience when an order went wrong ...On July 2nd I made my order online for several items. They were scheduled for delivery on July 10th. I received an email back with a summary of my order, and a message saying i would receive a confirmation of the order within 48 hours.After three days I didn’t receive any confirmation and so I sent a Facebook message (July 5th) asking about my order. I got a response quickly, and the representative told me someone would look into it to see if the order / payment went through or not, and that they would be happy to book or rebook for me. I was also told that I would get an email within a few days if they were able to book/rebook. So it sounded fine ...But I didn’t receive any emails. I checked in again when I got no response, and the representative told me to check in again in two days.Then, the second time I checked in I was told the department was away and that I would have to wait longer ...Then FINALLY, 11 days after asking, on 14 July I was told that the payment didn’t go through and I would need to rebook the whole thing. (And of course, you often have to wait a few days to a week for a delivery to be scheduled and to arrive.) My delivery was supposed to arrive more than a week ago, now it will probably be another week or two ...Here's what I'm not happy about. If I’d known from the beginning my  didn’t go through, I would have simply rebooked and not had to experience such a delay. It was very confusing I got an automated email that summarized my order but that the order didn't go through. Also strange that the department was \"away\" and nobody knew the status of the order until 11 days after I asked about it.And of course annoying that I had to check in a few times only to get nowhere ...For all of that I thought it was reasonable to ask for some sort of discount on my rebooking.They said it was not possible but that they would offer me two free lunches to visit their store ... I don't really see that as a good solution though since I was never planning to go to the store in person and would need to spend money to drive or take transportation there. I told the rep that, and the rep said \"I cannot offer you anything of more value.\"The customer service team was trying to be helpful I think, but unfortunately it seems they can't offer anything of real value to upset customers or provide much assistance when problems come up. The good thing is that the customer service reps were pretty quick to respond.So I don't blame the people I spoke to -- but the system, policies, and how it's set up which doesn't make much sense to me."

Ikea customer service would not help me change my address or get myself a new card because I thought I had my fiancee on my account. This was a month ago when I applied, do you think I would remember if my fiancee was on the account or not?! Ikea needs to change their security question!

I tried typing in my order number to see if that would work, but they only had the tracking option. Therefore, I tried calling customer service.

The 3 problems encountered were: (1) missing baseboard in storage compartment (2) one side arm fit poorly - had to be forced down and now can't be removed to adjust cover, (3) IKEA-USA apparently does not stock mattress cover and sheets in European sizes to fit this sofa bed. I tried phoning IKEA at 888-888-4532 multiple times to report the missing part. Every time the recorded message said the phone lines were busy and hung up. I then submitted the \"Missing/Damaged Merchandize\" form online, reporting the missing part. Instead, I was informed that a replacement for the entire sleeper sofa would be shipped and that I would have to disassemble the first sleeper sofa for return to IKEA. I refused the second shippment and replaced the missing part at my local lumber company at my expense. An attempt to write a review on the IKEA site failed because the review button was inoperative. This was my first purchase from IKEA and will be the last."

On the day booked, no one showed up, no information was provided for any delay. We made several calls to the CS phone line during the day, no real help was provided to get clarity and timeline of the team's arrival.20 plus calls and a personal visit to complain/ find a resolution to the matter, the technical team showed up on the third day, while we were required to be on standby. During this period, we have received several promises, none of them were fulfilled. We were not able to use the kitchen for any function during this period. The work was completed during the course of one working day, with no rubbish or cleaning done by the team of 2. We are a young family with my wife who is 8 months pregnant, and I had to take 3 days off without any notice while normally working in another country. Awful experience, the stress caused was very high on both of us, and wish never to use IKEA ever again. This is the exact opposite of the fake values communicated by IKEA in their marketing."

Filters are gone, you can't sort the product by price (low to high price or versus)... I gave up my online shopping. Customer service said \"Our website has changed to fit along side the global IKEA pages\" which is not even true, because the US site is still the same.. Won't really shop again online until it's fixed."

  "articleText": "I am rating the Ikea webshop, which has recently got a makeover and become absolutely horrendous. Before, there was some logic in how product categories were displayed and I could easily make a sub-category choice, now the more specific categories have disappeared and you get whatever Ikea has chosen to display. Very frustrating to navigate. Since the only way I buy from Ikea is careful planning with the help of a website (cause, measurements!), I think I’m done, it’s not worth it to shop where the shopping process has been made so difficult."

Barbara in their customer service department should not be working customer service!  I even asked for her identification number so I could let management know and she said they don’t do that they only give their first name. Snotty and rude,  that completely their fault!  It’s not supposed to be billed until the item is shipped. Yet they billed me for two beds yet only one was shipped and yet I have to wait 10 days for a refund? What kind of customer service is this ??!!  Thought IKEA was all about their customers obviously they’re not I will stick with Amazon, Wayfare, Crate & Barrel and many others that are much more customer service-based! Shameful"

Then, the delivery men arrived during a rain storm, and asked \"can we come back another time? It's raining hard out there...\" all passive-aggressive-like. Sorry that your job sucks, dude, but it's still your job. They grumbled and bumped and scratched it all the way up, no doubt on purpose, then we find out that they sent us the wrong product! Then, when we try to have it shipped back, IKEA has the gall to refuse to pay shipping, and tried to make US pay for THEIR mistake! Never again, not when there's equally \"quaint yet cheap\" furniture at Target for way less hassle and free shipping."

I called the phone number given for customer service 5 different times and got the message that they were experiencing a \"high volume of calls\" and was directed to go to their website. These calls were placed both morning, evening and afternoon!  I went to their website and explained the problems online, and received NO response from this as well.  The phone number is the ONLY number you can call.  There is no number direct to the store where I purchased the items.  My receipt says I must report this claim within 48 hours! I guess I will drive to the store today with the damaged pieces - but I am very concerned that they will not help me.  I am not only disappointed but very frustrated. What has happened to IKEA?  I have purchased items before - many times- though several years ago.  I never had any problem with any products nor customer service before. There is something very wrong."

For damaged items, the recording said they were not taking any calls at this time. So.... I called back to speak with someone in sales, *since I knew they would answer). They rerouted me to the correct dept., and I waited close to a half hour for someone to pick up, but no one ever did.So....went on line and submitted a complaint about my broken item. Normally, when you deal with a decent company, they send you a courtesy letter that someone is checking into the issue and will be in touch within a certain amount of time. I've heard nothing from IKEA. Actually, they have lost a customer due to their horrible customer service. I don't even care about the broken pedestal anymore. I will never, ever order anything from this company again. I hope this will deter other's from dealing with this unresponsive company. Shame on them!"

Called customer service again, only for them to tell me they can't ship me this item because it's not available. I can't pre-order the item either to use my same-day only $25 off. Now I have a useless credit card that I can't close so I don't hurt my credit score and $25 off I can't use. Customer service was no help AT ALL. \"Sorry there is nothing I can do\" is the worst customer service ever. There is always something you can do to leave a customer happy.

  "articleTitle": "This is my worst eCommerce experience",
  "articleText": "This is my worst eCommerce experience, bar none.  If you want to buy something from Ikea, drive to the store even if it's 4 hours away, it will be less work than trying to convince someone to deliver it to you.I do like Ikea's designs but fulfillment is not their bag, do yourself a favor and go get it yourself.Their customer service is nonexistent.  You feel like you've slipped somewhere between a CIA behavior control experiment and the 8th circle of hell.I've never had the pleasure being on hold for 2 hours.  Not only that, it was to the wrong department and when they're transferred me the system dropped the call.  Truly a singular experience!The way the system is supposed to work:1. you place an order2. you get a phone call with a delivery window (robot, use a cell phone, don't use your business line)3. After you confirm they'll deliver.What actually happens:1. you place an order2. you never get a phone call3. they send an email stating that they missed the delivery and they might cancel the order / charge you for re-delivery and you need to call them4. you call them, wait on hold for 2 hours.  When you finally get a person they say you've reached the wrong department and they need to transfer you.  When they transfer you the system tells you the call volume is too high and hangs up.5. repeat6. you call at 6AM to reach them at opening time on the east coast and reach a person.  They reschedule the delivery and tell you you should get a phone call from the delivery company the day before.7. You don't get a phone call.8. You call the delivery company (T Force) and they tell you they have no record of your order.  You ask them to talk to Ikea, and after being pushier than you should have to be they finally find your order with Ikea. (quick tip: T Force can skip the Ikea phone call queue)  They tell you that Ikea has rescheduled your delivery and it will arrive Monday.10. You get another email promising a Monday delivery11. You don't get a confirmation call (again)12. You call T-Force back and again they can't find your order. (again)  They talk to Ikea again.  Hang up on you at least once.  Call back.  And you're told they're positive your order is cancelled and the only way to get a delivery is to place the order again.In all I have 6 delivery dates that Ikea promised.  Spent more time on hold than the round trip would have been to Ikea's store.  My wife I and I both called T Force and Ikea countless times.  Never once did we get a confirmation phone call. (we had them check the phone number, in case, and it was fine)  So at this point I'm going to certify myself insane if I try this again.So I looked online and saw that sensible people where calling their credit card company to have the charges reversed.  After only a few minutes on the phone, that was done.Good riddance to bad rubbish.I have the sneaking suspicion that T Force shares a large part of this responsibility.  It was their system that never called me.  I live in Santa Maria, California which may be way outside their normal delivery radius.  I wouldn't be surprised that they simply couldn't make money making my delivery and their system simply kicked me out logistically as irrelevant.  Then Ikea points figures at T Force and T Force points fingers at Ikea and they both hope you just go away."

I should look again tomorrow and call back if not delivered then.  No help from Ikea and I've never heard of a shipping company claiming delivery when it's on the truck still. I called FedEx and they were very concerned about a missed delivery.  They found the package the next day and delivered it.  Ikea could care less.  Contrast that with Wayfair when I had a missing package they immediately priority reshipped and gave me 15%  off my current order.  Will never order from Ikea again!"

  "articleTitle": "Oh no! Ikea",
  "articleText": "I ordered Ikea's play kitchen for my niece on the 20th May for delivery 22nd - to arrive in time for her birthday on the 25th. Instead of being given my one hour delivery slot on the 22nd I was sent a text saying my parcel had been delayed due to an unexpected issue, then the day after another text with the same message but preceeded by an 'oh no!', which was a bit bizarre. (Glad they find it so ironic) Rang DPD the delivery firm and got litttle information - call handler reading from a script promised delivery by ten that evening - but, it's now the 25th and still no delivery and no update. (Some of the calls to DPD are charged at a premium rate, so you can potentially pay six pounds to NOT discover why your order hasn't arrived) Ikea were polite and tried to be helpful but have no access to DPD's system and can't advise but can only apologise. So this is an ongoing review as to how bad DPD and therefore Ikea can actually manage to be - a week late with their delivery? Two maybe? Who knows - definitely not me - meanwhile i'm the awful aunt without a birthday present.It turns out that DPD and Ikea CAN better their awful record to date. My play kitchen wasn't delayed it was lost in DPD's system and they should have known at the beginning because if their records show a parcel hasn't been scanned it should throw up a 'red flag'. But in this case no red flag. (Tellingly, when ringing DPD, customers are forced to listen to a recording of the 'director of customer experience' urging them to be nice even if they're annoyed or want to let off steam.) So I return to to Ikea who issue gushing apologies and re-order the play kitchen to arrive on the 31st May. And, I'm gobsmacked to find, it's another no show on this date. DPD say they have no record of my re-order so back to Ikea who issue more gushing apologies because they've pushed my delivery date back to June 2nd and, despite having my mobile number and email, didn't bother to tell me. The customer service adviser agrees with every word I say, for example, your customer service is awful, your customer service is a farce and quite possibly a pantomime too, treating customers like this is inexcusable etc etc. (She doesn't seem to mind a bit of annoyance and letting off steam. perhaps desensitized after receiving so many complaints). So I'm still waiting to discover, twelve days past my original delivery date, will the play kitchen arrive!!June 2nd - still no delivery. Ikea now tell me that my re-order has been blocked due to the way the re-order was re-ordered! Assurances that everything will be successfully unblocked, authorised and ready to go some time in the future. Yawn, yawn. Can't even be bothered getting annoyed or letting off steam anymore. If you want anything from Ikea, GO TO THE STORE TO GET IT.My order finally arrived two weeks late. Woo hoo Ikea. Now all I have to do is assemble it!I emailed my complaint to Ikea over two weeks ago cataloguing each painful and frustrating step in the process of securing a delivery from them. I haven't received an acknowledgement or any kind of response so another big thumbs down for Ikea."

It has been 7 MONTHS and I still did not get the card. Now they do not even reply to my emails. The amount is not high, but still I expect a promise to be fulfilled.EDIT: they replied after I wrote here. Apparently they are still \"investigating\".

Had a lovely email from DPD telling me that I would receive an email with an hour timeslot. Checked the DPD website, the day it was due to be delivered, DPD had received the order but not the parcel. The following day I checked the DPD website again but had the same message so I rang customer services at IKEA. I received an initial apology and was asked to ring back the following day to check when the item would be delivered. The customer service  adviser was unable to call me the following day as apparently they can only receive incoming calls and not make outgoing calls. She confirmed that the parcel had been dispatched but could give me no further information. I did explain I thought this was rather appalling service as I had purchased an item back in December which Was no longer working and this was a replacement, (same thing but more expensive) given the cost of the item had decided not to contact them about it but just buy another. Advisor had nothing to say to that and just stayed quiet, only apologised again when I said how appalling it was! Absolutely awful service and having just read all the reviews on here quite shocked, I always used to go in person to buy items, think I’ll be shopping elsewhere in future!!"

We agreed to take one sofa home and they said they will help us with the order. They gave us the sofa and the sofa cover and we paid for everything and drove back home. We got home and put the sofa together only to find that they gave us a cover for a chair, not a sofa. I contacted the customer service and spoke to Tiffany who was very rude and unprofessional. She informed me I have to drive back to the store to return that one and get the right one and that is the only option. I explained that this wasn't our fault, they did us wrong from the beginning and she didn't care. I was on hold for 55 minutes then she told me there is nothing they can do I asked to speak to a supervisor, she put me on hold for another 15 minutes then she told me there is no supervisor available and I requested a call back and documenting this incident then she said there is a supervisor available now.She asked me to hold and I did for another 10 minutes then they hanged up. I am ready to give birth in 10 days and I explained to her this is a 50 dollar problem and we paid 2500 they should be able to deliver the correct item for us as a courtesy.

Read very carefully Task Rabbit’s terms and conditions for using YOUR personal information — if you read that you might not want to do any business with them! I bought a bed with drawers on Easter weekend and was told I could book assembly quickly via a link online (through Task Rabbit). Tried to book assembly  only to get stuck on Task Rabbit platform because they ask for “postal code” but don’t mean where you want the assembly done but mean your credit card billing address postal code. So I entered the postal code for where I wanted the goods that I had delivered assembled (and my credit card information including code on back) just to have the link not work (but was able to find out through my credit c co. that Task Rabbit apparently did a check of my credit c billing address! So their online platform tells you nothing about where your credit card info went and you just get a  link that doesn’t work to get you to the next step of connecting with an installer — but someone has that info to be calling my credit c company. Task Rabbit customer service useless - you get different replies from different people (just like at IKEA).  you get automatic reponsr saying your email may be answered in “days”. To top it all off a Google search of Task R reveals they were the subject of a data breach! So this company now has my credit card information and was unable to use it for he purposes intended (assembly) but has it while the customer wonders why the screen is not advancing to the next step.  IKEA does not care about a customer’s post purchase experience — instead trying to blame it on a totally independent company TAsk Rabbit (which is really IKEA). Their “customer service” agents are rude and try a lot of doubletalk! Think twice before dealing with IKEA on any items requiring delivery and especially assembly through Task Rabbit (and check that you really agree to Task Rabbit’s privacy policy and terms and conditions for doing business with you. Is this what you want with a company that had a major data breach?? Also be prepared to get spam emails from Task Rabbit offering many services  - even if they can’t do the job you are trying to arrange! Buyer beware."

They later informed me that drivers can only deliver to the address registered, so why didn’t the customer service agent I spent over a half hour on the phone with that morning inform me of that policy? They also only deliver to my area on Thursday’s, which meant we would have to wait another week for our furniture. End of story, I received a refund and will just get my furniture elsewhere. Would not recommend IKEA or their customer service."

  "articleText": "We purchased a kitchen and a dishwasher from IKEA. The dishwasher broke 4 months ago and is still under a warranty. To get it repaired one needs to go through IKEA and than through their subcontractors. Subcontractor cannot be contacted once they leave your home. They came 3 times now to fix and failed every time. Finally it was replaced and broke again after 5 days. Customer experience of dealing with IKEA and their subcontractors has been terrible. We still don’t have the working dishwasher and all the kitchen elements where the machine was fitted are not as they used to be (ie doors cannot be closed , one kitchen door is broken as a result of removal and installation of a new appliance). All in all , terrible customer experience which is really disappointing as we spent so much money with IKEA over so many years. we asked for a store credit (no amount specified) as a matter of showing respect to us as loyal customers who suffered tremendous inconvenience as a result of this especially as we have a newborn so without working kitchen it has bee really challenging. IKEA did Bit want to hear about that. Therefore we need to raise awareness about poor products and poor customer service and overall experience with IKEA. Good news is there is a lot more choice on the market at affordable prices so we have a lot more options than IKEA. We advise against IKEA kitchens."

  "articleTitle": "Absolutely useless",
  "articleText": "Absolutely useless. I applied for an Ikea credit card on the evening,  and may I say, late evening of Thursday 3 - 7 - 19. I was excited and I already had in mind what I wanted to buy and had been looking it up on their website.The next day, I was then told some 18 hours later that I was supposed to of used my card that I very evening to have gotten my $25 off my first purchase,  'even though I had no physical card in my hand.'So within those few hours before midnight on that Thursday evening I should have used this card to have gotten $25 off my first purchase.One of the most ridiculous things I've ever heard of in my whole life, and so poorly explained on the credit card application.When I called the following day some 18 hours later I was told by 2 Ikea employees, (Ben being the second,) that I could never get this $25 again to use.I cancelled the credit card instantly via Ben. I've already posted a blog about my experience on Facebook about this and I will be filing complaints with the Better Business Bureau, anywhere that has reviews on Ikea and also consumer affairs. People need to understand how ridiculous Ikea is and the bank that supports them.UPDATE:As time went on a complaint was filed with the Washington DC branch of the Better Business Bureau. Richard S in the corporate office at IKEA promised to send an e-card with $25 on it to an email address that I've used for almost 22 years and I check daily.Never once did these number ever appear in my spam folder or my inbox. Then my other email address was given to him which I've had for 14 years and check mane times daily. Once again no $25 numbers ever appeared.Finally Christine called from Ikea's Corporate office and left a message on my voicemail after I had talked to this particular lady the day before. At the time of this writing she said in a voice mail which was 17 days ago now, that a physical card would be mailed to me and would arrive in 7 to 10 days. Of course, no card has ever arrivedI've recently filed a complaint with the attorney General of Washington DC and Mrs Carter there has forwarded my complaint to the appropriate attorney General of the state that the Ikea is in.I've come across a few other companies that are this awful with their constant lies about sending things to the customer. Let's be honest here, if Ikea were true to their word they would have spent a few extra cents and had this so called physical card sent to me with a tracking number. Even more simple, they would have called me on the phone and just given me the numbers.I'm NOT surprised in the slightest that this company has a got a 1star review."

  "articleTitle": "I have had an appalling",
  "articleText": "I have had an appalling, unacceptable service with Ikea. I purchased some kitchen units on 17th April 2019 (Order ID 1027803844) and they were delivered on Good Friday however there was one item missing - a galvanised suspension rail to hang the kitchen units on the wheel which is a vital component.After eventually finding the telephone number for Customer Services I got through to a lady called Cheryl and I was asked if I minded holding while she contacted the driver. On coming back to me I was told the driver had a look on his truck but could not find anything but would have a more thorough look at their next delivery and if they found it drop it around to me. In the meantime she said she would place an order for it and get it out to me asap, however, because of the Easter weekend could not get it delivered to me until Tuesday morning, this mucked up my planned DIY weekend.On 22nd April (Easter Monday) I just had a gut feeling that something was going to go wrong with my delivery today as this is not the first time I have had a bad experience with IKEA, and sure enough I was right. I was told by a lady called Ketsya there had been a system error and the order had been blocked, and that they now would not be able to get this to me until Wednesday morning. I demanded to speak to a Supervisor and after 15-20 minutes arguing I was eventually put through to the floor supervisor Kelly who I proceeded to complain to. All she could do was offer me apologies and say that she would send ne a £20.00 gift voucher, which I believe is rubbing salt into the wounds as it just giving me a voucher to plough funds back into their company. I was assured by her and her colleague that I would definitely receive my missing item on Wednesday 24th April between 7:00am-1:00pm.I was sent an acknowledgement email confirming this and given a new Order ID - 1027110192. I have taken more time off work to receive the delivery.My tale of woe does not end there - At 7:58 this evening (23rd April 2019) I got an email with the new invoice and saying that the delivery date is 25th April (Thursday) - As you can imagine I have had no other notice to say the date has changed and was extremely angry.Again I got on to Customer Services and spoke to an advisor who said there was nothing they could do. I demanded to speak to a Manager and eventually after much reluctance was put through to a Mr Paul Taylor - Again I proceeded to complain, and he apologised but said he could not do anything or get the item to me tomorrow, I again said this was unacceptable and although it may seem petty that it was for a strip of metal that hangs the kitchen units, firstly it was an essential item and secondly I keep getting promised that I am going to receive it and it never happens. He said he was just going to see if there was anything he could do and put me on hold.On coming back to me, he then proceeded to say that the only way I could get it earlier is if I went to Croydon store and picked it up - I explained that this was not good enough and that as a Manager he should be doing everything he can to get the item to me tomorrow even if it means sending the strip in an estate cab or on a van from the store. The Croydon store is a 30 minute drive from Bromley South.I have now told him that I either want him or someone on his behalf to get in touch with Croydon and arrange for a delivery of my missing item by tomorrow and if this cannot be done I want to know why but I expect a call back from both his department and Croydon Store and if I do not receive this call by 11:00am tomorrow will not only be taking it up with the British Head Office but will be writing to the CEO in Sweden Mr Jesper Brodin . I wonder what his department would have to say about how the UK Customers are treated.My advice to everybody reading this - Go to B&Q or Homebase - I wish I had doneMark Potter"

  "articleTitle": "IKEA \"missing assembly\" unfair charge",
  "articleText": "I will omit the details that it was difficult enough to negotiate with the IKEA service. Was everything described by other users - not possible to reach by phone, ignoring emails, cutting calls, etc. Finally, the kitchen assembly was scheduled for me on March 15th.  Despite the fact that on the 15th I needed to be in the office, I asked for a leave to wait for the kitchen assambling. The time in the letter was indicated from 7 am to 9 pm, so I woke up at 7 am and began to wait. I was sitting literally next to the door, checked the doorbell in advance. The fact that I was at home can be checked with CCTV cameras. Unfortunately, after waiting for a whole day, noone came. In the evening, I went downstairs to check my mailbox I was very surprised to see the letter that they were coming, but they did not find me at home! This is an absolute lie. The saddest thing is that IKEA invoiced me for 75% of the assembly (371 euros without VAT), which I have to pay before April 15th. This is a cheating and fraud. Obviously, this is an established IKEA service scheme, to receive money without providing services: the situation repeated afterwards,with the next assambling service. On the day of delivery I got a call from the contact center by phone and and they said that the assembly workers could not reach me. I said a second, I will now go down and open the door. And a minute later a miracle happened - the workers finally managed to press the doorbell! And, finally, everything worked, I opened them and I did not have to go down. It is very strange, why they could not press the doorbell before someone called me from the contact center? I want to clarify that the house where I live is absolutely new, everything is in excellent condition and perfectly works. And on the dorbell downstairs my surname is written, as well as on the doorbell on my floor. Going to protect my rights - want to withstand this conscienceless scheme."

Within 2 weeks of sleeping on it central portion of mattress dips in the middle and this depression appears permanent as dip has never gone up. I weigh 8 stones and don't turn much in my sleep. No one else sleeps on the bed. IKEA sent someone from Ecomaster to inspect mattress who confirmed there was a a dip. Two days later IKEA sends a letter saying \"The fault reported is due to the mattress being ontop of an uneven surface, therefore IKEA will not be taking any further action on this matter\". My bed, not from IKEA, is less than two years old and none of the slats are broken, defective or uneven in any way. IKEA's 25 year guarantee for this mattress is worthless."

  "articleText": "My order has still not been delivered properly. The original order date was March 15 to be sent to my parents address. My dad was there to sign for the order on March 21, but the delivery driver dropped off someone else’s order and not mine. I contacted IKEA and the customer service rep told me they would have someone pick it up and drop off the right order. She asked if I wanted to change the address for delivery and I said yes, change it to my apartment. So I wait a few days and receive a call it’s going to be delivered March 25. Then on March 25, I get a text from the delivery driver with a picture of the furniture dropped off at the original address, not the one I had changed it to. I went over to my parents address to pick it up, and only 3 of the 4 boxes were there. When I spoke to the delivery driver, they said they were only given 3 boxes from Ikea in round rock. But clearly on each box it says 2 of 4, 3 of 4, and 4 of 4. I didn’t get box 1 of 4. The delivery driver said he would still come to my apartment to pick up the ORIGINAL wrong persons furniture from the very first drop off, which he did. I called IKEA to tell them I am missing box 1 of 4, plus explained all of the problems I have had with this delivery, and the lady said they would be shipping me an entirely new dresser with all 4 parts. I told her I only needed box 1 of 4 but she insisted they resend everything, and the delivery driver would pick up the other 3 boxes when they drop the 4 boxes off. She gave me the delivery fee back, but when I asked for a manager or supervisor to explain this and get some sort of discount or anything really for all of the trouble, she said the manager would only give the delivery fee back. So I said okay and verified with her the dresser would be coming to my APARTMENT address. She said yes and they would call me when it’s being delivered. Now it is April 1 and I am still waiting for the dresser and have not received one call saying it will be delivered soon. This has been such a terrible experience. I won’t be buying from IKEA again and highly recommend not using their delivery services simply based on my own experience. When I spoke to customer service the second time, the lady was nice but made it seem like errors are quite common. If I don’t get the dresser by this Friday I will be asking for a refund and will take it as a lesson to simply never order from there again. I understand mistakes happen, but this many in a row with no effor to expodite anything has caused quite the mess."

Some bright spark had removed twenty of the most important component, the dowel.Obviously, cut the person's fingers off, but more to the point, including tax and delivery this item cost me £139.00 and it doesn't matter how good the unit WILL be, if after a week or more it still resembles a pile of firewood, then I say there's only one person, dept, to blame, and that is Ikea quality control.I have learned my lesson, I will shop at Ikea again, but not until the next ice age has been and gone. You're quality control stinks!!!!*****It is now a few days later and still nothing!!! I'm really pleased these people don't do coffins!........It is now over a month since I had this delivered, and still there are now dowels. When I phoned again, I was told the first girl didn't bother ordering them! How is this company still trading?"

  "articleText": "IKEA has nice products, not always at good price not to say sometimes expensive for the quality BUT the worse part is their after sale service policy which is not admissible They just care to sell the products & do not care about the after sale service. I wonder how many more years this company can survive without proper customer services. Of course they have a \"Contact us\" \"mail us\" options but no one will never reply to you . For example, 2-3 weeks back, I wrote them complaining about the repair of my leather reclining chair. Till today no one to reply to my mail.  Even if you put a comment in their \"comment box\" no one will have the amiability to answer you back. It is just a formality.Arpy T from Dubai"

So back to calling Ikea again and told their had shreddded the relevant paperwork with right case number on.  Had a call back and finally got the right reference number to be told wait .... it takes 3-5 days for the money to clear ( this is meant to be helping us  with the financial side of things  whilst we wait.  Anyway as luck had it the money came through earlier.New appliances are due to to be fitted tomorrow. Data protection breach is being investigated as we speak.

I had to spend hours waiting / trying to carry the items to home, because the delivery was late / refused to move the items upstairs because they were too big.At this point I think IKEA should just send everything with PostNL. At least that'd be on time, and I would carry the boxes upstairs myself anyway."

The hardboard back would not slide to the top and frustratingly became jammed, would not move forward or backwards, about 3 inches from the top. In our effort to remove it it broke. Ikea replaced this a few days later at no extra cost, the replacement frame and other 80 cm frame were easy to assemble. However the exact same thing happened with the 60 cm frame. The only solution offered is that I disassemble the second faulty product and get another exchange. So two out of four faulty units. Not impressed. I have guests this weekend, have run out of time and a spare room full of half assembled wardrobes, and a bed piled high with its the future contents. I would be wary of this product"

Discovered ONE screw missing at the end (should have been 24, but there were 23). Contacted IKEA via webchat, and they arranged to send out a spare immediately (7 day delivery time).They sent 10 spare screws a few days later.Cabinet looks nice, is strong, and the drawers are silky-smooth with loads of space.The simple moral to be gleaned from many of the negative reviews is that if you can't assemble flatpack, don't buy it in the first place."

I have paid using a credit card and as I didn't receive the payment confirmation I have paid with my debit card too. I wasn't aware that I have paid twice. I have acknowledged the double payment after few days after checking my account. I had to cancel the order as one item wasn't in store. Only one payment was returned in my account and I struggle since then with the Romanian Customer Service. I have claimed the reimbursement of the second payment . The last conversation and email I had with them was received  on the 28th of December when I was informed that the payment will be done within 14 days. I know that the 14 days of waiting are not over yet but I am not sure that they will pay me the money back as I was already told the the money were send in my account few time since I have submitted the complaint. I fell like Don Quijote fighting the wind mills. Can IKEA Bucharest answer the question: When my money will be in my account?"

  "articleText": "Put off IKEA forever.Purchased an £850 Pax wardrobe with sliding doors. We had no problem putting the unit together, but the trying to hang the doors was a nightmare. There were some grommets that kept falling off, we had to take the doors off and remove the shoe racks to put them back on.  They wouldn't stay on, the door was screeching and one of the doors got scratched. We called IKEA, they sent ecomaster out. They guy came and said it was a manufacturing fault, he didn't even attempt to put the grommets back or stop the door from screeching, he said that he would recommend a replacement door and IKEA would be in touch. Two weeks later I contacted IKEA only to find out that ecomaster logged it as a customer fault, he said that we didn't put it together properly and he noted that both doors were on the same track. (that's not even possible, they are sliding doors, the rail isn't long enough to have both doors on the same track) complete lie! So after much fuss IKEA agreed to send ecomaster out again, this guy asked us for some felt strips, which were not in the box, he said this is why the door got scratched. Again he's going to refer this back to IKEA, and again I wait to hear from IKEA and ended up calling them. They again told me that the case was closed, ecomaster logged it as a customer fault, completely opposite to what he told us. Fortunately this time we recorded the whole visit. I'll be contacting trading standards. I will never shop at IKEA again, in fact I purchased a number of things for this room, and I returned all of it. There are plenty of other places that sell similar and better products."

We ordered several products for delivery and the delivery dates changed constantly. 2 items are still not delivered and aparently they may never be delivered due to the manufacturer not making any more of the product. I thought IKEA was the manufacturer? Also why sell something when you know it may never be available again? I’ll stick to buying in store from now on,"

  "articleTitle": "Had to email CEO for resolution.",
  "articleText": "I bought a set of bunks which developed an alarming wobble after being used just 12 nights over a 5 month period. We dismantled them immediately for safety reasons.I contacted customer care who wanted us to rebuild them for inspection at my house. I refused & said they were more than welcome to build them if they wanted to look at them. They refused & after much back and forth, it was agreed that if I returned them to my nearest store, over an hour away, they would be refunded or replaced.Drove 50 odd miles to Warrington, only to be told that they weren't going to do as promised, but instead wanted to rebuild the beds first. We had to leave them there & they would let us know the next step. This was Monday. I finally got a call back THURSDAY (after leaving at least 10 messages) telling me the beds aren't faulty. The ray of sunshine on the phone obviously watched Liitle Britain \"computer says no\" sketches to pick up tips on how to annoy customers. She refused point blank to give me the name of the head of customer service, the store manager & was basically as rude as she could get away with.I got straight off the phone, Googled the CEO of IKEA to get an email address. Within 5 minutes, an email was winging its way to Javier Quinones. Less than 12 hours later I had a response & after a couple of emails exchanged over the course of the day, a refund was offered & accepted.Without a doubt the most inept & frustrating customer service experience in my entire life. I would suggest going straight to Javier Quinones, if he gets enough complaints, he'll realise how truly awful some of his staff are."

  "articleText": "My family and I had a horrific experience with IKEA yesterday. After finding out that we had to pay and then pick up an item with customer service, we headed to the waiting area. First and foremost, I believe someone should have informed us how long the wait would be - to give us the option to stay and wait or to leave and come pick later to pick it up.My family and I waited for three hours. Beyond ridiculous. After an hour and a half, I finally couldn't take it anymore so I went up to the desk and asked what is the hold-up because our number was in the \"red zone\" for all this time. The rep. told me that our merchandise requires a forklift so that's why it's taking so long and to give them another 15 minutes. 15 minutes turned into 45 and still nothing. IKEA got to do better before they start losing good customers. Because this experience has left a bad taste in our mouth."

I had a kitchen from Ikea - when delivered it was found that the Salesperson had made a very grave error. Half were missing and some item didn't even fit. After many weeks of consultation it was agreed that a refund would be given - this to hire a joiner to put the kitchen together - however, first the payment went off my balance due - then I was told on numerous occasions it had been put onto my payment card - but it had not. Then I was told it was all ok. Then I get an email from Ikea, I must contact them immediately. I was told I had not been paying - I asked if this refund had any bearing on it, as Ikea cocked it up in the first place. To cut a very long story short, even after holding on the telephone for 14 minutes for an advisor to come back to me after making an enquiry I was told my account would be re-aged and that it would ensure that the account would be cleansed - and no detriment to my credit status would be given - Oh Yes! - two letters later, one advising I would have problems getting credit, and texts saying contact now - it is obvious that nobody has bothered to do what they agreed. I have sent letters - an Official Complaint - recorded delivery - I am yet to receive a response. All this is having on affect on a condition I have, and making me ill with worry. I have to wait their time now as it is no use me ringing as I could not stand the waiting for hours only to speak to someone who hasn't a clue.  Beware with Ikea and Ikana - Please"

  "articleTitle": "IKEA: Southampton",
  "articleText": "What! IKEA's average rating is a one. That's strange.IKEA is one of the best constructed stores on the plant. The neatness they have to withstand for their furniture shop to keep running is incredible. If IKEA would not have any order then the shop would never exist.Firstly, their quality is sublime..... cannot really put it into words. Anything you buy from IKEA will never break. Desks, chairs, pillow cases whatever..... they are all fantastic.Secondly, their prices which in my opinion are overpriced. But then again IKEA make up for that with the quality and extraordinary quality. £600 for a 2 seat chair is not ideal to be honest and you could probably get a sofa at a 'sofa specialist' for half the price. Saying that though IKEA quality is superb.Thirdly, their co-ordination is excellent and once you have gone to the store four or five times you will fully understand it. Little tip for everyone who goes to IKEA in Southampton: park on the top floor as the entrance is on the top floor. So the lower you park, the more time you have to waste on a escalator. Showrooms and the look at items in a full glimpse are on the first floors and then all the items in wooden packaging are at the bottom which you can pick up and pay.Fourthly, their food is not too shabby either. For a company which is Swedish which specialises in DIY Furniture their food is pretty good. They sell relatively Swedish food (of course). Most of their meals contain meats (meatballs as well as hot dogs). It's not bad and its relatively cheap.Sublime this shop..... really is!"

Got an email telling me what day to expect delivery, a huge window of time so I took the day from work to await its arrival. IT NEVER CAME. Later I reached out to them, waiting on average 45 mins to 1 hr to talk to another person only to have them tell me \"Oh yes it's been rescheduled.\" I did not receive a notification nor any kind of heads up. THIS PROCESS REPEATED 3 TIMES.  They outsource shipping to a third party delivery company, and when I would reach out to them directly the sketchiest excuses would be offered, \"the item was not on the truck, an issue with our driver, mechanical issue with the truck.\" Me: \"You do this for a living.\" Starting to feel scammed, I DECIDE TO GET A REFUND, AND LOW AND BEHOLD THAT'S A PROCESS. There's no clear way via Ikea online to initiate the refund process. I used every contact point available to finally have them reach back, encouraging I continue to wait - this being a month after the original delivery time was set. IN THE END, I HAD TO OPEN A CLAIM WITH MY BANK TO BE REFUNDED THE CHARGE. ABSOLUTE TRASH, STAY CLEAR."

  "articleTitle": "Very poor service",
  "articleText": "Extremely disappointed with Ikea’s online service. I ordered a wardrobe four days ago and received an email to say it would be delivered between 7.30am and 11.30am today, so I took the day off work to wait in. It didn’t arrive at 11.30am so I checked online to see if there was a delivery update and it said it would be arriving by 1pm. It never arrived at all. I called customer services and after waiting on the phone for a good while I was told it was out of stock but it would be back in on Jan 13th. Why take the order if it’s out of stock? Why not notify customers? I would never have known had I not called up. I wasted a day’s holiday for no reason. I’m getting a refund but not until 7 to 10 days apparently. Very poor service."

  "articleTitle": "IKEA online ordering",
  "articleText": "I quite like IKEA as a physical store but have been less than impressed in the past with their online presence. Their website is limited in choice and delivery charges often high if you only wanted one large item.This time I wanted some Tradfri Wifi Bulbs which had a reasonable deilvery charge and were much cheaper than 'Hue' equvalents. An order number, status and delivery date were given after ordering but three days after the delivery date passed nothing arrived. On contacting IKEA (with a 15 min wait on the phone) they said the the order had not gone through processing despite the website still saying the original delivery date. The order was cancelled and reordered over the phone but again the delivery date passed. I contacted IKEA again and was told that due to high volume of orders it would not now be delivered until nine days later. Not taking the chance I cancelled the order and will go for alternatives via Amazon.I never understand how a company like IKEA can do mail order/online sales so badly and they really need to get a tie in with someone like Amazon and get delivery with 'Prime' for next day delivery (at least on the smaller items)."

Unfortunately it seems the lady put the wrong details on the paperwork (from a previous delivery to the same address) instead of using the details from my original order - so this never arrived either.My email complaint bounced - they seem to only have a call centre with a constant 30 minute wait! No other way to get in touch.At this rate it'll be easier to go to a store, but I have no trust that they'll even help because I placed the order online....TOTAL WASTE OF TIME. do not consider buying from IKEA online."

  "articleTitle": "\"Computer Says No\"",
  "articleText": "Having purchased wardrobes for one bedroom had them delivered and a damaged item replaced, which the delivery driver noticed when dropping off and experienced a tremendous fitting service I was ready to use the whole products and services again for a second bedroom. Just an observation to start, when a company buries its customer service telephone number deep in its website the company is not really concerned about customer service. Also you really find out the approach of an organisation to customer service when something goes wrong.Having purchased the wardrobes and them being delivered I noticed there was another Pax Wardrobe which had been left incorrectly. By the way I live in a small flat and two Pax wardrobe boxes take up a lot of space and cause considerable inconvenience. After 48 hours I had not heard from IKEA regarding their Pax wardrobe I eventually found their telephone number and called them. My expectation would be that we would simply agree a date and time for pick and that would be it. The response from the operator was abysmal, the tone, the amount of information requested, the lack of any apology and the inability to offer a date and time when the wardrobe could be collected. Absolutely appalling. I had to put the phone down. All I heard was a 10.00am to 4.00pm window and an hour slot from another company. I paid my money to IKEA I am an IKEA customer, IKEA should resole the huge problem of an unwanted Pax Wardrobe. Having put the phone down. I emailed IKEA giving them 3 dates when it would be convenient from my standpoint to collect the wardrobe. I got a response in over 24 hours, \" Unfortunately we cannot give a smaller timeslot than 10am - 4pm as this is set by the delivery company. We also use an automated routing system which plans our routes based on how much stock we have to deliver and where - we cannot override this\". So I am being told a human being cannot override a computer system. I am not bothered about IKEA's inflexible approach and their deliveries, I have a wardrobe of theirs which I have stored for nearly 5 days and is very inconvenient and will be even more so tomorrow when the fitters come to install my wardrobe. My questions to readers is; am being unreasonable to expect a slot from IKEA which means I am not sitting waiting 10.00am to 4.00pm for some other organisation to contact me. Am I an IKEA customer or have I missed something. Please beware folks, a good product does not equal a good customer service."

The cutlery was just as disgusting with bits of food.- When I complained a member of staff snatched the glass from my hand and said 'it's just potluck'.- Not a single table was clean and most were empty, I had to clean my own table.- The person who took our payment didn't even give a receipt.- I complained to the manager who was doing the dishes while other staff stood around doing nothing.

This review is not against the shop or products, its against the customer service and delivery.We spent over £600 on wardobes and a chest of drawers, we have just had to arrange our 5th delivery attempt. Reasons for this have been that the delivery company lied about attempting to deliver, then the goods were damaged, then we have had two cases of not all the items being in the van so we are still waiting on two items. I have spent hours on the phone to customer service where one guy hung up on me after explaining the issues in detail, having to recall and re-explain...I am heavily pregnant and we are desperatly trying to get our house ready for the babies arrival, we have had no apology other than 4 lots of £30 'waste of day' compensation - which is not good enough... We have had to change work diaries, change weekend plans and have absolutely no trust that our items will be delivered. It is without a doubt the worst service I have ever received and I am looking to see how I can escalate this further."

Arranged for delivery of whole new item and return of the now faulty one at the same time.Later that day on assembling a desk that had to be purchased in two parts, I saw that we'd picked up one in the wrong colour.Back on the phone and once again great service and arranged for correct colour unit to be delivered/wrong one returned. No charge for either. Both the deliveries within 3 days of phone call.Even though both instances were our mistakes, and were purchased in store (and generally would need to be returned to store) they really went above and beyond to help.Actually, best customer service I've received from a large company in a long time."

Then I got a call from trucking company that they we deliverying.  Truck was a no show.  Trucking company said they delivered and I signed for it.  What kind of racket is this?  When I call IKEA to clear up message states “higher than normal call volume, can’t take your call.” Then they hang up.  What kind of large company does this?  Will never buy from you again.  Still don’t have table I was charged for and cant’ get a hold of anyone."

Your case is being managed by our specialists in the kitchen department and they are working to give you the best solution for your problem and they will contact you ASAP. On the other hand, if you want to make a reclaim, you can do so whenever you want from the customer service desk of your store.Me,  SAT 09:18Hi, the delivery is already, finally done. I think it would be decent that IKEA give me a really good compensation for this crazy delay and the poor customer service.IKEA, SAT 12:50Good news! Unfortunately, if you need to make claim it should be directly at the customer desk of your nearest store.Me, SAT 13:03I'm not going to talk to some random person (with no authority) at the customer desk. That would be MORE waste of my time. You should be able to sort this out here and now.IKEA, SAT 15:11There, you'll be able to fill a complain form that will be checked by the managers of customer service. After that, you will receive a letter with the answer. Because it has to be signed, we cannot manage it by this way.Me, SAT 16:32What do you mean? Because it has to be signed. That’s just to make it difficult for us customers. IKEA knows perfectly well what has happened. Fact is IKEA made an incredible mess of this and now you try to tell me to travel 50 mins in each direction, just because IKEA don’t immediately recognise a total failure. Sort this out!IKEA, SAT 21:17Hello! In relation to your query, we inform you that in order to file an official complaint it is necessary to go to the Customer Service desk at your nearest IKEA store: A complaint is an official document that must be written and signed by the customer, so it is not possible to carry out this type of action by telephone or through our social media. Thank you.Me, SUN 12:18I don't agree.YOU say that a complaint has to be signed at the Customer Service desk in an IKEA store.All decent companies realize when they have caused an unreasonable amount of inconveniance to a customer (check your logs if you want).Waiting for deliveries (that did not happened) in the house for 5 times, 4 hours each time. 20 hours waistedSpend approximately 3 hours in phone with IKEA.Final delivery, 50 days after the promised 6 weeks delivery time.Therefore, you should offer a compensation without me asking for it.Instead you say to me:Get in your car, drive 50 minutes, 62 km.Go to Customer Service desk and write a complaint, no idea about waiting time, so I put 20 minutes (to little).Drive back, same time and distance.Which adds another 2 hours waisted, plus the costs to drive 124 km.In order to, MAYBE, get a compensation."

I called one day prior re-delivery which was confirmed week in advance and found out that order was canceled! Nobody contacted me either through email or phone beforehand to update, nor I got a clear explanation how it happened.It's ridiculous how much personal time I spent on the line and talking to representatives from IKEA and North America Logistics with this two orders.The combination of price and quality is reasonable with IKEA merchandise, but I asked for full refund because I don't want to go through this terrible service knowing that my chances of getting merchandise ordered in mid October before New Year are rather slim."

As well has the drastic sunlight fading, it has pink blotches where the dye has come out completely.  IKEA arranged for Ecomaster to come and inspect the furniture and, lo and behold, it is supposedly caused by dye transfer from a throw (I don't use a throw) and the fading is from direct sunlight.  You'd expect this kind of fading over years, not a few months. I have always had furniture in the conservatory and none have ever faded like this IKEA sofa.

Only to find when it was delivered that an item the Main item was omitted. After waiting on line for over a half hour it was told to me that the order for the Ivar piece #892-482-05 I had ordered your fulfilment department had made a mistake on and deleted the order and credited my card back!NO messages to this until I called you!The item was NOT out of stock and still is IN stock! But the only solution was to inconvenience me more by issuing me a gift card for the £35 additional delivery fee with a delay of up to 10 days before the card would arrive before I could again make arrangements to order it and then set up for another delivery down here!In this day and age you would think you could take the order and omit the delivery charge and I would have been with the item by now. But no such luck. Chris who I just spoke to in your after order department could not have been less helpful! Only giving me the normal guidelines to what has already been told to me.I am still waiting this gift card and most likely will chuck it in the bin!Having a family card and valued customers does not seem to reign in with IKEA!Very unsatisfactory and would suggest you take a look at Trust Pilot to see how many Thousands say the same thing! Over all a 1 star rating!"

The stock check is for the most part correct, although the 'it may be in store' status means it probably isn't.The items are inexpensive, great quality and if you're not a complete idiot they're easy to install.I use Ikea 90% of the time for myself, I've decked out several apartments in Ikea gear, I'm a high end interior designer who specs luxury homes but I always trust ikea to sort my place out!"

For furniture and home décor which is inherent to change over time, I find IKEA a cool and creative place to buy things to make your home beautiful and a hub of creativity. My local store is GATESHEAD and I have received fantastic service  that's includes knowledge from staff, ideas, and at the checkouts. I love their restaurant because we can spend time with kids during shopping and it is not expensive either. I have ordered for home delivery and in all fairness, the delivery is expensive which is only downside about IKEA but has been okay and on time. I bundled up a big order so it was economical as compared to other providers. We recently bought a sofa bed which was not expensive (£350) with storage and cushions and its the best thing I have had lately compared to a leather sofa from Barker and Stonehouse which costed over £2000 and never came with fire tags and I had to pay £20 to remove it because no one would buy or take in for charity without the tags plus was so uncomfortable apart from looking slick. Some of the kitchenware in IKEA is so creative especially for space saving in your house. I visit IKEA for their ideas more than anything.In this age of trends, IKEA is my go to place."

The furniture is good quality and I've been quite impressed with them. The only slight problem I had was with Parcelforce who were supposed to deliver a small parcel. The day they were supposed to come, I heard nothing all day. Tried making contact with ikea which seemed impossible as their email system was down and I didn't fancy spending 20 minutes in a call queue. In the end, their twitter page eventually told me they were having problems with parcel force. I eventually got the parcel 4 days later. Still, it would have been nice to have been told this information."

  "articleTitle": "HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE",
  "articleText": "On Saturday the 08th of September of 2018, I bought a wardrobe (model: BRIMNES wardrobe/3drs 117x190 oak effect) and booked also the delivery service (£35) to get it delivered to my place one week later on Friday the 14th of September.I was told I would get it between 7 and 11am; since I had to work, I asked a friend of mine to stay and wait for the parcel as it wouldn’t be later than 11am, so she had time enough to go to her appointments. At around 10:30am I received a call from the driver saying that they were literally 10 meters away from my place but they couldn’t find my flat. Even though I have never experienced this situation before because all the deliveries always arrive without any issues, I did explained him what the street was and gave him enough indications to find my place. Without giving me a chance to explain that I had someone waiting for him, he did hang up the phone and he wouldn’t pick up the phone again at all.My friend stayed until 2:30pm and nobody came; she missed one of her appointments. We both were trying to reach the driver but he wouldn’t answer; he finally did, saying to her that they were coming back on a smaller van, even though there’s no need as my street is big enough, also I live just next to the corner, the could have parked there and walk the 2 meters between the corner and my door; my friend wouldn’t have mind go and help them to bring the boxes up.I went to the IKEA contact page on the website where I did found an email, the same that appears on the confirmation email when I bought the wardrobe, as a “customer service” channel. I did tried to send an email and the response I got (and this happened twice) was: “This mailbox does not accept direct emails, so your email has been removed.” (see screenshot attached); so, what is the purpose of this email?, is it just a placeholder so the customers think you actually offer a service?.I tried also the live chat, but I had to refresh the page several times until it would appears and disappears suddenly, I’ve managed to connect only twice, even though I’ve tried all day. The first time it was at around 12 the person in the chat told me they were 30 min away; I had my friend waiting for another hour and they never came; so he lied to me, he had no idea where the drivers were and he promised me they were just around the corner. After an hour of waiting, I did tried to contact someone again, through email. (I got the same response than before), through phone (never a response) and through the chat, which again appeared and disappeared constantly. I finally managed to talk to someone on the chat for the second time, he told me again that they were very close, I did tell him the situation, he told me again that they were “on the drop”, another one lying to me. He finally said that he could only follow the track, so they never talked to the drivers, they had no idea, and they were only trying to calm me down so I wouldn’t carry on complaining.It wasn’t until almost 5pm that I finally managed to get an answer from the driver, he said they were coming during the evening or first thing on Saturday morning and that he will call me back to let me know. Friday evening passed, not a single call, text message or email. Saturday morning came, same thing. When I went to check my “delivery status” it said: “we couldn’t deliver your parcel, for more information please contact us”. How come it has to be me who contact you if you weren’t the ones who didn’t deliver the parcel the day you had to.I did pay £35 extra to get it delivered at my door on Friday and it never happened, and I am the one who has to contact you; and how?, the email doesn’t work, you never answer the phone and the live chat barely works. Completely unacceptable. If you are not able to deliver the parcel as you promised, you are the ones who have to contact the client, let them know the issues and offer a new solution; instead, I had to spend at least 20 min on the phone on just waiting until someone could “help” me. The only solution was waiting until the EARLIEST delivery date which is Thursday the 20th September, almost a week later than what I needed it. I had to ask for a new delivery date, how come you didn’t put me on the list for next delivery?.I have all my clothes and belongings all over the floor in my room since Friday. I had to ask for the day off to be at home when it gets finally delivered because they gave me a very specific time, first, between 9am and 3pm, and finally yesterday, between 11am and 3pm. Asking for the day off means I don’t get paid for this day; I can’t work from home and I have to spend almost all day at home just waiting. My friend lost all her day on Friday last week, and I will lose mine and my money tomorrow.On top of all this, I booked a furniture assembly for last Sunday in the morning (through IKEA website with TaskRabbit), I had to cancel it and start all over again. They are coming tomorrow at 4pm and I really hope my wardrobe is been delivered by then.If I knew all this would happen, I would probably go to IKEA and take a taxi cab with me. Probably, it would be cheaper and, obviously, faster. But I did trust in your services and the disappointment was massive.The only way I found to get attention was posting comments on almost every single picture on Facebook, as Twitter wouldn’t work neither or any other of the channels mentioned before. I had to become an annoying person to get someone to talk to me."

Of course, as I’m installing, the last table leg will not screw in, even a little, but was stripped in the factory. I don’t have a car, so I ride my BIKE 50 minutes to IKEA for one thing: a new table leg. If I was rich, I wouldn’t be buying 25$ tables, and riding this many miles for a leg, would I? No, I am poor, and cannot afford the time or the table but I ride out anyway, determined to decorate my crappy Portland apartment.Upon arrival I am told they can help me, great! A nice blonde girl then asks me if all 4 table legs are the same. I have 0 idea, I told her I don’t know. THE TINIEST bit of product knowledge THIS EMPLOYEE SHOULD HAVE could have saved me. Me, being very intelligent but underprivileged, think quick to say: hey, here is the stripped leg. I carried it all the way here so YOU CAN COMPARE IT NOW. Do you think they followed through with the correct leg? OF COURSE NOT? Why be even a little intelligent and listen to me when you can be a stupid IKEA employee? She tells me to wait 20 minutes, takes my phone number to call me, and I leave. 45 minutes later: NO PHONE CALL. I decide to walk back in.Panic stricken, the girl tells me she has my leg. I get back to my apartment: still my table lays on the floor because THIS IS THE WRONG LEG.I don’t have a car, the level of inconvenience caused me by IKEA, specifically it’s product-unaware employees, is unforgivable. So many chances I’ve given Ikea. As long as I live, I will never, ever, buy IKEA furniture. I am going to burn that table to the ground someday, just because I dislike IKEA that much. I have a table I paid for, that is 100% unusable, even after 2 hours of biking and 45 minutes of waiting. So, so, so displeased. I will be posting this review everywhere possible. Nicely done IKEA."

We spent over 30 hours on the phone trying to straighten it all out and in the end we were offered $300 gift certificate and our delivery fee refunded, less than 5% of our purchase price, they should be giving us a much better compensation than this.  Once the compensation was agreed upon I was told it would take a week.  Today marks 4 weeks and we have seen nothing.  They seem so nice on the phone and seem like they will help but nothing happens, our order was canceled multiple times internally with out explanation.  Don't plan on getting responses via email either.  Sadly they rarely if at all respond to them.  We flip houses on the side and they put us 5 months behind and lost us a lot of money because we had to wait for the cabinets.  Will never order online again from Ikea."

  "articleTitle": "no show on delivery, no answering phone",
  "articleText": "I purchased my furniture in store and scheduled to have my furniture delivered on 9/14 from College Park, MD IKEA and ikea called me to confirm delivered time on 9/12. I was even given 5 different time slots to pick when to deliver to my home. On 9/14, I took time off from work. The furniture was supposed to arrive in the morning. We waited until afternoon, had to cancel our other appointment in the afternoon. Until the end of day, 9pm, we didnot see our furniture nor anybody call us. During the time, we called both the delivery company and ikea. No answer from both company. The delivery company has an answer machine but never return my call. Ikea simple hang up the phone with message saying they are too busy to answer. (I have call ikea many times after that, 9 out of 10 time I was hang up after the brief \"too busy\" message. I think they should at least give me option to on hold or be called back.)Anyway, after finally get in touch with the delivery company and ikea. They offer different story each time, and always blame the other company.The bottom line is, they had contact me 2 days prior delivery. If they could not put items together at warehouse in time, they should contact me. The worst case, the delivery company and IKEA should call me on the scheduled delivery day when they find out they could not do delivery that day. They should also fix the answering service. In this time of age, people complain being talking to computer, being hold for too long. IKEA does not give these options, they simply hang up.After search on Internet, I found I am not the only one. IKEA, wake up! fix your problem."

  "articleTitle": "Unacceptably poor customer “service”",
  "articleText": "Had I known the delivery company IKEA works with and it’s telephone support network was so sub-par, I would have saved myself the 4 hours I spent waiting for my order today and simply gone to the store. After not receiving any update on my order past my due delivery time, I called IKEA customer service only to be informed that my item had not been collected that morning. If that was the case, it would have been really considerate had someone contacted me to let me know rather than leaving me to wait all day and requiring me to call up to find out where my items were. Sandy, the customer service representative I called then assured me my items would be delivered on Monday evening and I would be able to receive a shipping refund if I stayed on the line. Of course, as soon as she tried to transfer me the call dropped so I spent a further 50 minutes on hold trying to reach a new representative only to be told it wasn’t IKEA’s responsibility but the shipping company and I would have to reschedule directly with them. I’m absolutely disgusted with the level of customer service I have received from the company and the company IKEA uses to ship your products. As far as I am concerned, I paid IKEA for my order and my shipping, therefore it is IKEA’s responsibility to deliver my order in full at the scheduled time and if not, IKEA should have let me know instead of wasting my day. It’s not long till my baby is due, the furniture I ordered was for the nursery and I’m supposed to be having friends around tomorrow to help me set up everything and have fun getting ready for the arrival of my baby. I am so upset and disappointed that I have to cancel this due to IKEAs incompetence. The items I ordered from Target and Walmart on the very same day arrived over a week ago...and the shipping was free. This is absolutely the last time I ever order anything from IKEA online and the experience has left me feeling so let down I honestly don’t think I ever want to give any money to this store again. As a European, myself and my family have always used IKEA furnishings for our homes, and my husband has furnished several rental properties with IKEA products but in the future I think I’ll be relying on more reliable businesses who can actually follow through with a promise once taking my money."

After 90 minutes on hold to speak to your call staff, all I've been informed of is that IKEA don't pack the trucks so it's not really your fault and that some pieces of the bed arrived therefore the delivery was a success.

How can I assist you?11:34:03 am\tjared lewis:\ti have purchased an Alex desk on saturday from your cardiff store. When it has been assembled the dwell holes in the top of the desk were not drilled deep enough by you the manufacturer and have therefore caused 4 dents in the top surface of the desk. i live 100 miles away from cardiff and am not prepared to drive all the way to cardiff to return the item. i can however send you a photograph and a copy of the receipt via email.11:35:08 am\tKayleigh:\tI am sorry to hear this. Do you have the article number for the item please11:35:42 am\tjared lewis:\tyes its : 902.607.1011:36:20 am\tKayleigh:\tThank you. Is it just a replacement top panel that is required?11:37:06 am\tjared lewis:\tno as i was glueing it together as it was put together. so it will not just detach which is a shame.11:38:32 am\tKayleigh:\tOk if you have glued the item then there is nothing we can do unfortunately. If you wish to return the item back to the store it would be at their discretion should they wish to assist you further11:42:06 am\tjared lewis:\tthat is completely unfair. i have purchased a lot of items from ikea and always glued the dowel joints with wood glue as this is good practice for the item to stay in tact for the long term. the glue has not caused the damage. the item being manufactured faulty is the problem. I have paid on my credit card so can go down the route of claiming the money back through them if you would prefer, as i now have written evidence that you are not prepared to help.11:43:28 am\tKayleigh:\tI do appreciate that however we do not advise for the item to be glued in any way as this voids the guarantee of the item11:43:54 am\tjared lewis:\tit does not say that on any of the instructions i received.11:44:41 am\tKayleigh:\tIt does not say to use glue, It advises of the parts that are required to assemble the items and that is not one of them.11:48:21 am\tjared lewis:\tthat is irrelevant you've just told me that the guarantee is voided if i use glue. which i have not been told on the instructions. if this was on the instructions then you would have a valid point. but it is not!! Using Pva Glue for Dowelled wood joints is good practice. any carpenter will tell you that. the item is faulty. If you are not prepared to either issue a refund or send out a replacement, then i will either have to contact my credit card company as stated previously or contact traded standards. if you personally cannot help me to resolve this Kayleigh then please can you get a manager to contact me. I am not a happy customer.11:49:57 am\tKayleigh:\tI understand your frustration and we could help you with regards to the item had you not glued this together by sending a replacement top panel. However as this has been done there is nothing more we can do. I apologise for this. As previously advised if you wish to visit your local store for assistance it would be at their discretion should they wish to assist you further however there is nothing further we can do from here.11:53:19 am\tjared lewis:\tcan you please get a manger to contact me. If you think i am going to do a 200 mile round trip then i will expect to be compensated for my mileage at £0.45 a mile on top of the refund/exchange. I would like to speak to your line manager as i am not happy. you can get him/her to call me. but i will be taking this further if i am compensated for a faulty item as a customer. this was not the only item i purchased when i visited the cardiff store. so i will be arranging a refund for everything not just this item.11:54:59 am\tKayleigh:\tIf you wish to speak to a manager you will need to call us on 0203 645 0000.11:57:31 am\tjared lewis:\tI've been waiting on the phone for 25 minutes before i did this online chat!!! i don't think your customer service is good at all i think i would have spent my time better reviewing the very poor customer service i have had from ikea on the internet for every body to see how poor you are . i would like you to arrange a manger to call me please to resolve this.11:58:07 am\tKayleigh:\tAs advised I can not arrange this as you need to call us on the number above.11:59:54 am\tKayleigh:\tUnfortunately there is nothing more we can do regardless of if you speak to someone else this is the standard process.12:00:00 pm\tjared lewis:\tim not doing that. I'm going to print our chat off put a claim in with my credit card company and put the chat online in as many forums and review sites as i can about ikeas horrendous customer service. thank you12:00:40 pm\tKayleigh:\tOk.

The 4 days went, 5pm came, no delivery - 1 hour waiting in the queue to speak to someone, only to be told that it would be coming, here's £20 compensation. 8pm came, no delivery, another hour on the phone, only to be told that the drivers had run out of time and that I should re-schedule (too late to do today), which would more likely be in 4 days time. Cancelled order, offered £30 compensation for wasting 6 hours (+1 hour writing an email to the CEO) of my time for nothing.Shopping with Ikea online is a waste of time and effort and it leaves you feeling incredibly angry and frustrated for being such a fool for trying it. I just wish I'd checked here before attempting it. Why they waste their time offering this terrible \"service\", I have no idea.

  "articleTitle": "Terrible Service",
  "articleText": "Terrible ServiceI had ordered a delivery worth quite a substantial amount of money which was meant to be delivered between 7am and 11am on the 31st August. After having a missed call from the driver I rang him back later to which he told me three different stories, one stating he had attempted delivery, the second saying he could not find the house and the third saying he would ring back in ten minutes with a solution. The driver did not ring back and actively rejected my calls.I then decided to web chat with customer services. This was another terrible experience. I was made to feel as though the whole situation was my own fault. The operator used my name at the end of each sentence in a patronising tone without even asking if she could address me by my first name. When asked what I could do about my delivery she stated the driver would ring me. When I asked what to do if this doesn’t happen she simply replied “they will ring” offering me no alternative solution or support. When asked about a refund the operator said I could only have a partial refund when my goods arrived, despite not giving me any information on how to do this. The whole customer service experience online and with the delivery man was awful with no concern or care for my situation.I then waited on hold for around half an hour to the customer service phone team. I was then told at around 16:00 that the driver was only on drop 1 and that I was drop 2. I wasn’t quite sure how this was possible considering the driver told me he had already been this morning.After several phone calls to customer services at 20:30 I was told that the driver had said I had not answered phone calls and stated he left voicemails which is completely untrue. I then had to reorganise my delivery and now won’t be receiving my goods until NEXT FRIDAY! I now have to wait a whole week more for a delivery due this morning. This is absolutely unacceptable and no refund has been offered.Overall I feel the company lack communication, compassion and organisation and I hope to never experience this level of customer service again."

I called customer service  and after a 40 minuete wait I was told a replacement would be sent the following week, I got a text saying it had been delayed by 1 week. The following week I got another text message saying it had been delayed again for one week the following week it never turned up and I received no message so I called up and I got told they didn’t know when it would be delivered and didn’t understand why I was so unhappy I I called up again to make a complaint and this tome I was told it would be sent out immediately for delivery Thursday but yet again nothing all I got was a letter saying thanks for contacting them it has almost been 8 weeks now"

I waited for over twenty minutes to get through to anyone and then the agent (Maria, South African/afrikaans accent) seemed utterly incompetent putting me on hold again for a further 15 minutes with no explanation as to why. Even she seemed surprised that I was still doggedly hanging on by the time she returned to my call. This morning, I've been calling since 8am as there are no online chat agents apparently, and the wait times have been between 20 and 30 minutes each time I've tried getting through. More people need to formally complain. Ikea makes a lot of money and this isn't good enough."

The staff at IKEA are clearly not trained correctly. It was explained to me that they are unable to call customers to make them aware if their delivery won’t be turning because their system doesn’t flag this up! We’re in the 21st century of course it can. Most ridiculous and incompetent people work in IKEA. Very rude staff.

  "articleText": "I wish I’d thought of checking out Ikea on trustpilot before ordering online.On 14th August I ordered a coffee table online as there were none available in my local store ( Belfast).I opted to collect it myself on  20th . I arrived instore after 2pm and was told it wasn’t yet instore....no text or email to let me know. Fortunately I’d a few other things to get so headed into the store. I happened to notice that my ordered item was available instore in a colour I assumed had been discontinued. I bought it and went back to the Collection point to say I no longer wanted the one I’d ordered. The assistant said I could easily cancel it by phone or email.No matter which, of several, numbers I phoned the automated voice said there was approx.a 30 minute wait! Decided to email. No reply in next 2 days. Emailed again......still waiting for even an automated acknowledgement.I’d no option but to waste time and petrol returning to store, waiting at Collection point ( had to ask passing assistant if it would be manned soon ) and then joining queue at Returns to get a refund!Most disappointing of all was the attitude from each assistant, especially the one who had previously suggested phoning or emailing customer services. Neither was in the least sympathetic and neither even apologised on behalf of Ikea. I was polite and friendly throughout....at a loss to understand this uninterested attitude, and so unlike the helpfulness of staff throughout the store.Due to Ikea’s wide range of affordable home products I know I’ll be back......but online is now out of the question."

Had to call them and was advised to call the delivery company to cancel the delivery and told that then refund will be issued, as of today 23rd August no refund issued into my bank account as yet, had to call Ikea very appalling customer service several times and first time was laughed at by some arrogant, self obsessed customer service operator who has told me that refund has been issued. As I did not receive any confirmation from them had to call them again next day just to find out that nothing has been done about it, requested management to give me a call and I am still waiting for it.....So just come off the phone after ringing them for the third time this week and was confirmed that refund will be back to my bank account within 3-5 working days......Happy to finally get my money back but please same yourself time and better drive to one of their stores to do your shopping as their delivery service is appalling and if you decide to get a refund you will have to wait for almost a month until they decide to do their job and issue you with one."

Over several years I have made many purchases in stores.  One item was returned, unopened the following day and I got a lot of grief before receiving my refund.  Several days ago I tried to log in to my account and could not.  Tried to get help by calling 888-888- 4532 but for several days all I got was that the circuits were busy. I tried email.  It took six days to get an answer that told me to do what I already tried.  As I write this, I have waited for 12 minutes for an email to set up a new password.  I have notified they say they will respond as soon as they can.  That's not good enough for me, because last time it was 6 days on this same subject.  I have better ways to spend my time and other places to spend my money.  I am no longer an IKEA customer.  I thought the Swedes had their act in order but I guess all that free love and drugs have taken their toll.  In the States, the CEO would have been fired months if not years ago."

  "articleText": "I have ordered several things from Ikea for work.  The first delivery was fine.  The second delivery was missing items and the two workers from Ikea that showed up to install the furniture smelled like pot so heavily I couldn't even walk into my office.  The process of finding out where the other furniture was, getting someone educated on the phone and getting my refund was ridiculous.  The third time I ordered something from them, I was told it would be delivered the next day and had to call the next week to find out where it was.  I had to call twice, because they didn't call back as promised.  I am now on the phone with someone who has no answers.  Ikea customer service has never been stellar but I\"m not sure who is in charge these days because the process is one of the worst experiences I've ever had.  Rest assured, this will be my last order from Ikea, where the customer service is as difficult as putting their furniture together.  If you are debating about purchasing anything from Ikea, I would recommend going anywhere else, even if it costs a bit more- it's worth it!!"

  "articleText": "I write initially on behalf of my Daughter & Son-in-Law. Whilst they are more than capable of posting their own review which indeed they will definitely be doing in due course if or when they eventually get over the appalling experiences they have had to endure over recent weeks.It has to be said we all visited the Southampton store and were suitably impressed particularly with the quality of everything.In brief a very large wardrobe and cabinetry were ordered & delivered in a timely & appropriate fashion, then everything was swiftly assembled by my Son-in-Law and they were both pleased overall.However my Daughter especially is absolutely heart broken at the subsequent follow-up order and replacement parts fiasco.From attempts to get through to customer service to shocking condition of products upon arrival.In terms of trying to contact customer services unless you have it would appear on average 45 minutes to waste hanging on the telephone just waiting for your call to be handled, furthermore taking time away from work waiting in all day for your pre-scheduled consignments to ultimately not arrive as promised on several occasions.When the goods do eventually turn up only to find the products not only completely strewn across the entire floor of the delivery vehicle but filthy dirty & badly damaged (yet still awaiting replacement parts)This I find totally outrageous given everything apparently that IKEA claim to stand for ???The net result of this all friends & family on our first experience will never purchase from IKEA again.They are in the process of lodging a formal complaint although having an uphill struggle with customer services, no surprise there then !I have awarded with a generous 2 star rating as you can tell we are absolutely livid !"

  "articleText": "I find IKEA the most boring shopping experience ever. Buildings designed for zombies to be carried round via arrows.And what is their stuff? Designed in Sweden and made around the world for the cheapest cost and then shipped to one of their zombie buildings. The environmental impact is massive.It is worth spending time to look at the Wiki page of IKEA and do your own research into their business structure, accounting and how funds are chanelled through Dutch \"charities\". It's a complete sham and kick in the nuts for the small businesses that pay their fair share in corporation tax.A dreadful store, underwritten by dreadful business practices. I have shopped there in the past but make a point of avoiding them now. In no way do I want to fund such a dreadful organisation."

  "articleTitle": "ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! IKEA YOU ARE THE WORST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
  "articleText": "I ordered a kitchen July 14 for a rental property thinking I would be saving time instead of ordering a custom kitchen HAHAHAH! Had a great experience with the store placing my order, and delivery was scheduled for July 31 as some items had to be shipped in from the warehouse.  July 30th I get a call with delivery window 2-6, Ok YAY! schedule help to stay for the delivery.  6PM comes and goes, I stay till 7:30, no call nothing, cant get through to customer service number. After an hour and 37 minutes on hold I talk to an agent who tells me sorry, but the system has to update tonight and you need to call back in the morning to see what happened.  I also called the store customer service given to me at the time of sale, guess what NO ANSWER, leave a message!  GUESS WHAT after four messages to customer service # in Orlando Store #145, NO ONE HAS EVER CALLED ME BACK.  OK back to my nightmare - NEXT MORNING, after about 2 hours on hold Ikea customer service tells me, XPO the delivery people have my order, I must call them to reschedule. I am given a number and spend about 40 minutes on hold for XPO.  GUESS WHAT? XPO says they dont have my order, I must call IKEA.  OK being more pig headed than smart, I call IKEA, well really I sat on hold again and finally talked to IKEA.  They put me on hold to find out what XPO says, and come back and say, YEP you're right, XPO says they dont have it.  THen proceed to tell me that a truck left the Georgia warehouse July 28 and no one has recorded its arrival to XPO Florida and I just have to sit tight until the truck arrives.  OK trying to be the positive person that I am not, I patiently await my \"call\" which NEVER ARRIVES.  What to do?  Spend more hours on the phone?? NO after a week of waiting, this dumbo drives 60 miles to the store. Sunday August 5, OK I spend time waiting on my number to be called in this DIsneyland of horror, and finally it is my turn.  I get an AWESOME customer service rep named BRI, who is determined to help me.  She finds out that the biggest portion of my order that was IN STOCK when I placed my order was sent immediately to XPO and received by their warehouse on JULY 16!!! The \"MISSING\" pieces from GEORGIA which havent found their way to FLORIDA in over a week, are still missing so we fandangle the order to cancel those items, so I can take them home form the store inventory! YAY getting somewhere!!  I am given the XPO contact name and DIRECT phone # (LOVE BRI) and am told I have to wait for the call from XPO to get my delivery window.  I DRIVE MY 60 MILES HOME GLOWING IN MY PROGRESS.  Sunday ends, no call from XPO of course.  SO I call first thing Monday morning to my DIRECT number, miracle they answer!!!! THey tell me Oh yes I see your order, oh so sorry, you missed the Tuesday truck, already full, and we are not in your area until THursday.  OK says my positive self, even tho that evil side of me is thinking that this isnt really real, its just all a big joke on me...Well Wednesday around 6PM I still dont have my \"window\" call, so I call them to the DIRECT line :)   Jessica and the ladies at XPO are very tired of me by now.  THey confirm YES you are on the list for tomorrow, YOU WILL GET YOUR CALL.  OK 8PM or so I GET MY CALL - window set for 1-5PM!! YAY!!  I schedule my guys once again!! We are all so excited!!!  THursday morning 10:30 am XPO ladies call me (thats a first!!) to let me know, we are so sorry your shipment didnt make it on the truck!  WHAT???!!!!! but we are going to make a special trip on Friday and deliver it to you! YAY again, I think? By now of course my rant is getting old and they really couldnt care less, and it gets me nowhere anyway.  They actually sit on the phone in silence until I shut up and wait about 2-3 minutes to make sure I am done before they will speak again, lol.  ANywayyyyyyy, THursday night I do not get a call, what a surprise!! So I figure why not try my direct number?  Its 9:30 at night, but what the heck?  THey answer!!! The lady is not happy to see on caller ID its ME ;)  She tells me she is working on the schedule that very minute, and could I wait a few minutes?? SURE the positive me says, Ok she tiredly gets back to me with my famous 2-6 PM window.  OK Silly me, I SET UP MY GUYS AGAIN to wait for delivery, HAHAHA they must think I have a crush on them by now, this delivery farce could not possibly be real.  GUESS WHAT ??!!! ITS NOT REAL.  Friday 2:35 PM I get a call from the poor XPO lady ( I think they drew straws and she lost) to tell me, OOPS it didnt make the truck again.  Well she didnt escape my rant, while I did try to remain civil I explained That i honestly did not understand 1) how she could work for these people that cause people like me to become raving lunatics 2) how could they have no IDEA why this shipment is so difficult to find out why it cant get on a truck.  CAN SOMEONE PLEASE GET OFF THEIR BEHIND INSTeAD OF STARING AT A SCREEN AND SEE IF MY STUFF IS EVEN THERE???  Well now XPO lady surprises me and tells me she has me on speaker phone and her supervisor would like to speak to me!!! WHAT THEY HAVE SUPERVISORS??????  I get to speak to MARK the supervisor, who assures me that he is doing what I suggested and getting off his tush to see if he can physically find my stuff, but he needs 2 hours to do that!  OK MARK and he assures me that continually ranting in detail is not helping lol.  OK MARK,  I dutifully await my call.  GUESS WHAT NO CALL!!  Surprise.  5:30 PM I call XPO and ask for Mark, kudos to him for even answering, LOL, anyway he proceeds to tell me that he called and it went to voice mail and my mail was full and blah blah blah WHAT?!!! Like I didnt have my phone glued to me these last two hours???? OK giving Mark the benefit of the doubt (My positive side again :)  and he tells me sorry, I cant find your stuff.  UGHHHHHHHHH  He had to assign my problem to a professional warehouse Ninja to take on the case and he would get back to me as soon as he could to up date me.  WHEN 2021??????? No timeframe, no estimate, NADA   So here I am, its 1:00 AM and I am still ranting, but thought I would do a constructive one in the hopes some poor fool DOES NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID AND EVER ORDER ANYTHING FROM IKEA TO BE DELIVERED!!!! YOU will fall into their endless pit of NO CUSTOMER SERVICE that will eat you alive.  ORLANDO STORE #145 still has not responded to ONE of the four phone messages I have left over the last 2 weeks. WHAT???  anyway I guess my only option is to make the 60 mile trek (each way) again tomorrow and see if the stuff I am missing (all 71 pieces) are in stock and I will cancel my order and let it die in the XPO IKEA warehouse cemetery.  Hope you had your LOL for the day, unfortunately from the research i have done this HORROR is the NORM with IKEA, not the exception.  WhAt A sHAMe!!! People like Bri in customer service and Sam in Kitchen sales do not deserve to have such a crappy company destroying their good service.  IKEA DOES NOT DESERVE THEM"

Somewhere in there, buried in the back were the pieces of my bed. The delivery men were exceedingly unfriendly; parking illegally and telling me I would pay the ticket if they got one (there was also a loading dock they chose not to use).  They non gently moved the pieces into our apartment. For that it was $100. The bed itself was very hard to put together-- the holes were all slightly too small, or slightly misplaced. We regularly needed a mallet.  Took two smart, engineering oriented people 5 hours to do a king size bed. ALl of our knuckles were bleeding."

After the three days pass from the delivery date, I called IKEA's customer service asking where are my shipments.

I asked if I could cancel the order since it would be so much easier and quicker to just go to the store and pick them up myself. Unfortunately, they said they couldn't refund me the delivery fee since my items are already in the trailer! WHAT?!Well, Okay.. then why give delivery date options? Why isn't there a better solution? Now I am just waiting again for the items to be delivered. NOT TO MENTION, the driver called me on the day of actual delivery day saying He is running behind. and he should be bringing the items a day after.  WAIT A MINUTE!!!??, didn't the customer service lady just told me it did not even leave the trailer? and why did he call me then? what is going on??!!!I don't even know at this point.

Apparently, they hadn't actually received the order from Ikea yet.I tried calling Ikea customer service, but I just kept getting the same message that \"all circuits are busy.\" Weird, I thought.Two days later, I get the same automated call saying my order would be delivered between 11am and 3pm the next day. Sure enough, the same thing happens.I called North American Logistics customer service again, and they said it looks like they still haven't received the order from Ikea.I try again to get ahold of Ikea customer service, FINALLY get through, wait for a representative for over an hour only to be told there's nothing they can do, and they'll have someone from a different department call me back the next day.Fine.The next day comes. No one calls.Honestly, the timeline wouldn't be a huge deal if 1) anyone at either company could tell me where the heck my order is, 2) I wasn't getting phone calls about scheduling a delivery that North American Logistics doesn't even have, and 3) I could get some semblance of a timeline in order to prepare. I've taken TWO afternoons off for this now for nothing.Now I keep getting the runaround between the customer service departments at Ikea and North American Logistics. No one has a clue what's going on. This has been the worst order/delivery/customer service experience I've ever had.Ikea had no problem taking my money, but they're having a serious issue with follow through.I will never shop at Ikea (online) again, nor would I recommend it to anyone else.UPDATE: I finally spoke with a helpful customer service agent at Ikea who was able to create a replacement order. She also offered (without me having to ask) to refund my original shipping fee of $59. My new delivery date is scheduled for August 17th, exactly one month after the original delivery date."

  "articleText": "Firstly, I don't understand why you need to wait so long on the phone to connect with them.  It's not believable that they have an \"unusually high call volume\" at 10 a.m. If the products are so good and the sales high, then employ more competent people.  That said, I had a good experience ordering a sofa online (although labor intensive to make sure you are ordering correctly) and good with the delivery 125 miles away. Inexpensive for delivery which is a plus. Ordered a bed online for delivery within the St. Louis area. Mattress & pad came, no bed frame.  Incredibly difficult to reach them.  Equally as difficult to arrange for delivery.  Very frustrating for such a progressive type of company. If you don't live near them to pick it up yourself, you are at their mercy."

No warning, No explanation. IKEA actually said the wardrobes had been fitted,  until we offered to send photo of the boxes. Then they accepted they hadn't been fitted.Rebooked AGAIN for 21st July. More confirmation they would arrive.IKEA rang at 1pm on 21/7/18 and said the fitters should have been with us at 8am.Fitters said they would be here.21st July- The fitters didn't show up. AGAIN. IKEA said they were coming!!Each time IKEA confirm the booking and reference number and say they will arrive.We have now had 3 weeks of a house full of boxes and clothes with no wardrobe.What do you do ? They said they would send a voucher as compensation but didn't.It's taken us several years to regain our faith in this company, as their customer service was so bad the last time we used them and give them another chance only to be very badly let down before on several occasions.I shall not be using the shop again."

Every time I call IKEA there is a huge wait time and when I finally do get someone on the phone they then transfer me to the resolution department and I have to hang up after an hour of wait time.

Definitely not worth $804.00. Not a nice color and not comfortable at all!  I really don't want this couch, but trying to get another $804.00 back from your company would be another joke within itself!IKEA... you really need to refund my money back to me... it has now been 11 businesses days and your letter you sent states 7-10 business days to receive the money back."

  "articleText": "Recently paid IKEA Puerto Rico to take measurements of two bathroom vanities.  Placed order with IKEA of two vanities along with delivery and installation services. After a couple of weeks IKEA came back and said one of the vanities was discontinued, so we opted for another option in their catalog.Got call from IKEA to coordinate delivery of vanities, received one and second one was in back order.  Next received notice from installer to coordinate installation.  Installer came to install vanity, but upon opening box he noticed that it was defective.  Called IKEA for pick up, but they refused to pick and instructed me to take back directly to store for replacement.  Went back to store to exchange vanity, while there coordinated installation of it once again.Today installer came to my home to install vanity, but it was one inch too wide and could not proceed with installation.  Once again, IKEA personnel had taken measurements of area and recommended equipment based on area's space.  By now, I'm completely frustrated that I will probably have to drive back to IKEA store for credit or exchange of vanity.I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING AGAIN FROM IKEA OR RECOMMEND IKEA  TO FRIENDS OR FAMILY.  IKEA PUERTO RICO SERVICE IS DEFICIENT, UNPROFESSIONAL, AND COMPLETELY UNORGANIZED."

All of them were shown as available for online shopping. After proceeding to the check out, I saw the service fee costs 59 Euro! My whole shopping cart was 24 Euro and the website has asked for 59 Euro of so-called \"service fee\".Opened a chat box with their support and guess what was his response? \"Probably, some of the items are not available and the system calculates them to be delivered with trucks from warehouses!!!! We are sorry!!!\" Sorry?!?! What the...?!?!? Your website killed 2 hours of us and you are simply sorry?! I said, so why does the website show them as available? He replied: \"We are sorry\".You MUST be sorry. This is a shame for an enterprise like IKEA. If you can't manage your online stuff, then don't offer it. Don't sell online and don't make this huuuuuge amount of angry clients.I won't buy even offline again. Thanks for wasting our time."

  "articleText": "Shopping online from Ikea is the worst experience I've ever had. I placed online order for 9 items. I had to call customer service (on hold an hour an a half) 2 days before expected delivery date because I wasn't going to be home. The woman on the phone said to give them the days that would work for me and they would put it through to the delivery service to contact me to figure out a better day. 2 days later I get the notification that my delivery is on it's way (this is the day I said not to deliver and to reschedule.) I call customer service back (on hold over over an hour) and they tell me they have no record of a reschedule. So finally we get it figured out that I will get it on Saturday  (with a large window of time so I was basically on house arrest waiting for it). When it finally comes, one of the items was missing (the largest and most expensive - a kitchen island). I call the deilvery company, they tell me to call Ikea. I call Ikea (on hold for 45 minutes) and they told me to call the resolution center the next morning because they are closed. I call the next morning (on hold for 50 minutes) and they tell me the item is not available in my area for delivery and that they can issue me a refund and my only option would be to drive to a different state to go to a store and get it there. No where online does it say it's not available for delivery in my area. No where during this whole process was that information ever conveyed to me. I honestly don't know how Ikea think this is acceptable to put people through this. I've wasted so much of my valuable time dealing with the reschedule and trying to figure out where the kitchen island is. I've never had such a horrible experience in my life. Ikea has lost a customer."

After many calls to their very unhelpful service centre who didn't seem to know anything I was driven over edge and exercised my right to cancel the contract under the failed delivery clause.They are now left with a £2k made to measure worktop that will not fit any ones kitchen but mine and frankly they deserve it.Have now got a Magnet kitchen fitted instead.

  "articleTitle": "Terrible delivery issues!",
  "articleText": "This is my most recent email to the Ikea customer service just so you get an idea of how bad it’s been.Hi there,I’d like to make you aware of an ongoing situation regarding my delivery which has caused extreme stress, excess use of my own time and time out of my job.I placed an order 23rd June to be delivered Saturday 30th. It didn’t turn up.So I called customer services on Monday 2nd July to find out what was happening. Apparently they didn’t have the stock in the warehouse so obviously they couldn’t deliver. However, I was not made aware of this. The team member offered me £35 store credit which I have not received, and re ordered my delivery to come from the Lakeside store on Saturday 7th. It didn’t turn up so I called the Lakeside number provided in the email and they told me there was an error with the order. So they re ordered it for Tuesday 10th and offered £30 store credit which I have not received.Monday 9th I called to make sure everything was right with my order and that it would arrive the next day. But the order was done wrong again and they re ordered it for Thursday 12th. No compensation offered. But this time the team member told me she had her supervisor check to make sure the order was placed correctly.So today I was expecting my order to finally arrive, I had tracking sent to me. Then I check tracking just after 2pm and it tells me delivery failed. I call up, and am told they didn’t put my house number in and that’s why it failed. Refused to offer any more compensation in any form, even though I explained the situation and the issues before. And re ordered the delivery to arrive tomorrow, Friday 13th.I called again this evening wanting to make a manger aware of the situation but was told they don’t have one, just a floor manager, but he can’t speak to me. So I should email this address.This situation has taken so much of my personal time and caused so much stress, I’m heavily pregnant, and work 50 hours a week and shouldn’t have to chase team members mistakes twice a week without them contacting me. I’ve even taken a day off unpaid for one of your delivery promises which cost me over £85.Please show this email to the highest possible of management as this situation is unacceptable and should not be down to me to fix every time and wait longer and longer for it to be fixed.What has been done in terms of compensation is no where near enough for all of this hassle, and to be honest, I don’t want any more Ikea store credits as I don’t want to shop with you again. I want the furniture I ordered, the store credits I’m owed, and to be done compensated some other way.Please listen back to all the phone calls as well if you record them to get an idea of the situation better.I will be sending copies of this email to your CEO and Country Manager.Madeleine"

I contacted them and was eventually told it was due to a system error. Re-scheduled for 20th June. Did not arrive. Spent 2 hours on the phone to a helpful but super slow chap at Ikea who tried all sorts OD different avenues to get the kitchen to me to no avail. Now rescheduled for next weekKitchen  fitters were booked - they are owed for 8 wasted days at a cost of £3k. Time off my  self employed business £400. No kitchen - living in a building site with a microwave for company.Where are my 154 pieces of IKEA kitchen? Who knows.Angry, upset, frustrated. Rest of building project was put on hold for the kitchen. Endless time wasting.Very disappointed as I love IKEA products. The only way to complain is by Email as you never get to speak to anyone other than phone operators.My advice - don't buy an IKEA kitchen!!"

One sofa had all the nuts bolts and connectors missing. 4 phone calls nothing resolved. Took  1 hour 40 mins and  3 staff to resolve the following day at Customer services. The nuts and bolts connectors to be posted out after the next holiday renters  arrive.  All items removed at my expense to storage! Purchased another sofa for the rental.

  "articleTitle": "Display products not in stock",
  "articleText": "We went to buy a crib for our daughter who is expecting soon.  We decided to get the Sniglar Beech crib and changing table which are inexpensive, and the changing table is small which was perfect for my daughter’s tight space.  We picked out what we wanted from the display area and we to go get it from the pick-up area.  Both products were out of stock.  After some time, we finally found someone to assist us.  She said the crib would be in stock in a couple of days but she had no idea about the changing table as it did not say in her system.  I went back to get the crib and even though the changing table was available online I decided to wait a few days.  Well, big mistake because not only did it not restock in-store but it went out of stock online.  I emailed customer service and received a rather terse and unhelpful reply that said due to manufacturing issues the changing table would be out of stock until November.  She offered no solution other than to wait until then.  I was very disappointed because at this point the crib had been put together and we did not want to disassemble and return and the box was gone as well.  Being a unique color, we are unable to match it so we are having to get a white changing from another store.  Admittedly it is much nicer but it is also bigger and more expensive.I do not plan to ever shop at IKEA again.  My local store is like a maze.  I find it confusing and stressful to shop there.  Also, the rep was not sympatric or helpful.  Her only solution was to wait 5 months which is not a good solution since the baby will be here in a few weeks.  I do understand that there may be manufacturing issues out of their control but they offered no viable solution or concession to me.   She refused to sell me the floor model or give any kind of credit or discount toward a more expensive item or any other thing that would have made me feel better about their company."

  "articleTitle": "Supremely inept with horrendous customer service",
  "articleText": "Father in law bought 2 new large wardrobes and bedside tables, paying for delivery to Southport which was quite the premium of 35 quid. For such a high delivery price you would expect a premium service but on delivery the guys taking everything upstairs noticed the wardrobe doors had not had any hinges packed. They instructed him to call Ikea directly there and then to report them missing and verified this while he was on the phone. Very apologetic they assured him they would be sent out monday morning and take 3-5 days delivery which in my opinion was the first poor customer service choice. It was their error not packing the hinges so the parts should have been sent out as special delivery guaranteed next day.One week later, he had to call them again as the 3-5 days passed and no sign of the hinges. The call centre drone was very sorry but they hadn't even been sent out but would guarantee they went out monday via parcelforce and should get them in a couple of says. He would also process a £20 discount as a goodwill gesture.Amazingly after another call just over an hour ago, he was told that (yep you guessed it) hadn't been sent out or 20 quid refund prompting him to go quite ballistic though not swearing, resulting in drone no 2 terminating the call.How is it possible to have a company with the size and reputation of Ikea to be so blatantly uncaring and incompetent towards their customers? I can see why there are so many 1 star reviews as they are quite simply appalling. The mark of a company is when there is a problem how they rectify that to leave a positive impression on the customer to ensure they come back again. After this performance, none of our family or friends will be using this sorry excuse for a company and I encourage others not to either."

  "articleText": "While Ikea might provide a decent product line, their customer service(should really be 'lack of') should make you think twice about buying from them. We had a delivery from Ikea the other day which contained multiple packages and boxes. After signing for delivery the driver walked out with our receipt and we realized an item was missing. When we called him (the driver)he hung up on us so we attempted to call Ikea customer service. The wait was 45 minutes so we attempted to file a complaint online, filled out the form and try to submit but the system was not working. Makes me wonder if Ikea\"s management thinks their customers are ignorant and willing to accept terrible treatment? They will never get any business from us again."

  "articleTitle": "The IKEA Delivery Service is a big SCAM!",
  "articleText": "Never ever EVER order from IKEA online. I am unaware of the in-store experience but I definitely know about the online store. First off, £35 delivery charge for what exactly? Petrol costs? Lifting up the items for you? What is the delivery charge paying for? Anyways I ordered a table, not too complex, a table top and legs. I ordered the table and I get the confirmation and all of the information and a delivery date & time. I wait patiently and go out of my way to wait between those hours. Waiting and waiting, no delivery. I call them and I ask, hello where is my table? They said that the table top wasn't in stock and they are going to get the table top and legs to me in a few days. So here I am a bit satisfied that they are going to get the table top in stock to deliver, oh was I wrong. Another delivery date missed. Called them again and they offered compensation, thank you for that e-Voucher for YOUR store I don't really want since your service isn't worth any money. They say it will be delivered the next day, oh surprise surprise ladies and gentleman, NO DELIVERY. This is when I am just fed up already, a company which is this popular should not be this poor in service and quality. The way they deal with their delivery services is abysmal. You'd think it's organized by a bunch of wannabe business people. I mean that's probably correct. Anyways they told me they will try to deliver again on another date, the day comes, it's a sunny day and I am waiting patiently, I received a text message saying my delivery is on the way and I can use this tracking site to watch where the truck is going. I open the site up and I can see the truck and it's surprisingly on the way, I then keep refreshing it obsessively because I really crave to have something I paid my money for! Believe it or not. I then see it approach the road near my house (this is about 100 meters away) a literal 1-minute drive to my house. Before you know it, bobs your uncle and off they drive back to the warehouse and another unsuccessful delivery date. The most useless, preposterous, poor example of a multi-millionaire company. Thanks for reading this review, please listen to me and the other 2,000+ who are livid with this thing called IKEA. Have a good morning/day/evening. Thank you!"

  "articleTitle": "IKEA online ordering is a nightmare. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.",
  "articleText": "We attempted to order online, but the website continually failed.  After hours of frustration, we decided to order via phone.  The representative was unable to spell our street address repeatedly (it's 3 letters) and was generally all over the place.  We confirmed that they had the shipping address verbally, they read it back to us letter for letter.  We confirmed that the shipping address is in fact different from the billing address.3 weeks later we get a call that our deliver has arrived.  Only its 3 states away.They delivered our purchase to the billing address, NOT the shipping address.  To be clear, we confirmed that they had the correct shipping address multiple times.  The contracted shipper just... couldn't be bothered to differentiate between the shipping and billing address.IKEA's customer service was nothing short of horrendous.  After waiting on hold for hours (average wait time is 80 minutes, all the while they tell you how \"fast and easy\" online ordering is) the representative say they have fixed the address and we will receive our order in 2 days.  Okay.We get the confirmation minutes later, again, with the wrong address.  Call again.  Wait on the phone another hour and a half.  Now the Ikea rep says they can't change the address.  Okay?Wait on hold another 30 minutes.  Ask to cancel the order (because this company is horrible and won't get another dime of business from us).  Hold 30 minutes.   Screw.  This.  Company.  Their delivery service is garbage and their customer service is garbage.Having a different billing and delivery address is not complicated.  I mean... this is a furniture company... they should be able to deal with customers who have recently moved.  The fact that our purchase was delivered to the wrong address, and then the company repeatedly failed to remedy the situation, is inexcusable.   Customer service just blames the contracted shipping company, but then gives no contact information to speak directly to the shipper.  Zero accountability, and we had to FIGHT to get the full expense back to us for what is clearly a complete failure on the part of the seller.  We'll see if we even get a refund.Will never do business with this company again, and advise others to steer wide clear.  Horrible business who could care less about customers.  Disgusting business... pay more to a company that has a shred of respect for their customers or buy second hand."

Plant some trees wait for them to grow and in the mean time master you’re carpentry skills because I guarantee you’ll get your kitchen before I do!If someone high up in Ikea wishes to contact me please feel free to do so as I’d love to speak to you.Have been using IKEA for 10+ years and I won’t be bothering anymore.

  "articleTitle": "Probably worst customer service I've experienced, ever.",
  "articleText": "There are many layers to the issues I have experienced with IKEA, but best to start from the beginning.1.) I had ordered items from them at the beginning of May, for delivery at the end of May. I was sent an email confirming that the delivery would be made. I took a day of annual leave to receive the items, however they never arrived. I called in to ask them about the status of the delivery, whereupon I was told that the delivery truck was stuck in traffic. I waited for another hour and then called again, at which point I was told that the delivery would not be made due to a glitch. I explained that I had arranged for people to come over and assist with the furniture (who were travelling from quite a distance away), and the fact that I had to take annual leave to receive the delivery. They basically showed no empathy and said that they would deliver the items on the following Sunday and would refund me the delivery fee. When I explained to them that I now had no furniture and that they should have communicated the glitch to me so that I could make alternate arrangements and cancel the people coming to assemble, they basically shrugged it off.2.) I had finally got through to someone on the phone who was helpful and understood the inconvenience caused. He agreed to refund the costs of an air mattress...to date I have still not received my refund, after submitting the invoice twice. The emails that come from the IKEA customer services are all generic and do not show any empathy, all they were willing to do is hammer home that these \"glitches\" happen and they could only refund me the delivery costs. When I explained to them that I cannot even unpack my new house because I have no furniture, they didn't care.3.) Sunday arrives and my delivery is made. Well, only one item out of 15. When I called them to ask where everything else is, they basically said there was another error and it will be delivered the following Friday. This would now mean another week of no furniture and no bed. When I explained to the customer service representative that this was now ridiculous and I wanted some form of compensation, I was once again hit by the rigid: \"only delivery fee can be refunded\". Once again no empathy is shown and I had people over on the Sunday to once again assist me with the assembly.4.) Today, out of the blue, I receive an email stating that the delivery date has now been changed to Sunday. Once again I have to now reschedule plans because they have decided to change my delivery without telling me why. Also, I won't be able to build my furniture on Sunday and as such I will now have another week with no bed and clothes and computers on the floor.My issue here is that nobody cares from IKEA. The attitude is certainly not consumer friendly, and given their volume of business, they genuinely do not care. I have not been refunded for the air mattress and at no point did they offer a discount or assistance in assembly, considering it will be me paying to live in a house with no furniture. At no point was it communicated to me that there were stock issues. How is this fair and how can IKEA get off with no culpability in this? Judging from their Trustpilot score, I seem to think that I am not the only person with these issues, and I also think that they genuinely do not care given their size. I wish to escalate this, but customer services keep passing me on to another agent who tells me the same thing."

We started with 6 fixed  wardrobes, glass front, slide doors, shelves, racks, about 60 items altogether. Main boxes were not in stock at the time we were in store, supposed to be next day, then weren't, we spent 2 weeks trying every day on line, always something was missing, wrong information about availability, then we reduced order to whatever was at the time, we moved forward to payment and couldn't pay, as some items were not available even though were in stock a few minutes before when browsing. Then we removed almost 50% of order, bought whatever we could, paid on line with delivery, next day had a call that some items are still missing, we cancelled it and requested refund, got it confirmed then same day courier rang that is making order and some stuff is missing, we told him it's cancelled, he was surprised (???). We are trying to buy at least the big parts for those wardrobes for more than a month now, hoping to collect small things over time, it's not far, but again, things available becoming unavailable when it comes to payment and availability information stating around 8 weeks, which might be wrong later anyway. Customer service is super helpless over phone and email, twice gave us most useless information ever like \"please try again another day\". We are slowly giving up idea of buying from IKEA, we had plan to buy kitchen after that, but having this experience, are looking for other shops already, before we even started. Is somebody from headquarters controlling what's going on here? It's not only the worst Ikea branch but the worst supplier in the whole city."

  "articleText": "I ordered a mattress on finance within the Reading store and the man working took my details down incorrectly meaning that when my first payment was due, the payment declined thus affecting my credit score (about to arrange a mortgage so sounds a lot worse than it is).Called Ikano to amend payment details and they then took the details down incorrectly AGAIN!! thus another strike on the credit rating.Made a complaint to them but they basically couldn't care less and blamed IKEA (even though the second time was their fault). Called the customer service line and whilst they sympathised, they told me that I had to go into the store and lodge a complaint there.Myself and then my partner have been back twice so far and have not heard anything back from IKEA at all.I am in the process of complaining to the financial ombudsman but unlikely that I can have these impacts on my credit rating removed without IKEA helping out. They are not prepared to do this.Whilst IKEA are a good company to use for small bits and pieces around the house, if you require anything that requires post sales service, they are not for you. I will now be, and have been since, using John Lewis for any larger purchases as this would not happen on their watch. They actually care about your experience and I fear this could have been resolved in a more timely manner without so much time and effort from me.IKEA, your reviews are appalling and consumers are beginning to care more and more about it. If you want to continue your success in the UK, you may want to think about how you treat your customers."

I also asked to talk to her manager which she did not do as I wanted help to get this taken care of.I will never order anything on-line from IKEA again. I did the on-line order to save 4 hours of driving time. I would much rather drive and not deal with this. I can't see ever using their products again. Their customer service is the worst I have ever experienced and I am 69 years old.I continue to wait on hold listening to their recorded message about how easy it is to use their on-line system over and over again and how quickly they will respond shortly. How unbelievable that message is given my experience. I don't know how much longer I will wait for the resolution manager but need to get this fixed, so I wait."

We were told by the staff that all items were in stock and set delivery. Great so far, so good. We also booked assembly service for the following day.We got an e-mail confirming the time was 11-3 on Thursday (a week day off work). No delivery!! We call and they tell us sorry but some of items were out of stock after all and they would not be coming!! Nothing they can do!!!So we re-arrange again this time for Sunday, promised 11-3. We get another e-mail and text comfirming delivery, we call and change assembly team too. Again it doesn't come!! We call and are told, oh sorry some of your items are a months wait now or discontinued so thats why they didn't turn up!! We asked why we were not informed about this and they just said sorry!! We cancel the items which are my childrens beds and who are already sleeping on mattresses in their rooms and my little girls chest of drawers! and ask for the rest to be delivered!! We are given another date and again re-arrange delivery and assembly who knows if it will come or not!!!!The best bit is that IKEA can't give me a refund back to the account for items or assembly, I have to go back to store and get it!!! Awful!!!!! Please avoid at all costs!!"

Delivery cancelled twice as the delivery van had the wrong date. The system showed correct date so my booking was correct. Removal was booked which was not done as they said 'item needs to un-boxed'... how do you unbox a sofa? and they couldn't even bother to help my mom (who was there) to explain what they meant or even help her with it. Turned out on the second appointment they had meant to remove the screwed bottom legs(!!). In this entire scenario, i wasted multiple days bookings for deliveries, re-deliveries and removals, aside from the three trips i made to the store... for one original trip to buy a bed and lamp and remove sofa ...never again."

Bad - unacceptable experience simply does not capture the neglect IKEA has for the atrocious experiences they create for their customers.Absolutely awful. If you're in New York City, their 3rd Party Delivery Service is just as bad - if not work.Be prepared to WAIT ON HOLD FOR HOURS while they DO NOTHING and, if anything, work to screw you over with extra delivery fees and faux delivery attempts (wherein delivery personnel take pictures of your apartment to \"prove\" they attempted delivery), but in reality, simply wait to get into your apartment building to capture the picture and avoid actually delivering the objects. They literally don't call, or knock, or buzz. They just get a picture of your apartment number, and that's all they need to prove they tried. THERE IS NO WAY TO TRACK THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR DELIVERY. The customer service center you will deal with and the delivery service is purposely kept independent."

The first one, the delivery men refused to bring the wardrobes I had ordered up to my flat and left them down in the (public) lobby area. I had to frantically take one piece up at a time on my own, risking having some of it stolen as I couldn't watch them all the time. The other experience was more recently - I ordered a bunch of things online, got several emails and text messages (from the courier, ParcelForce) telling me when I'd get the order - I was impressed - the only problem is it was all lies. I didn't get any of the items when the text messages said I would. After staying home all day to receive the delivery and getting nothing, they'll probably now try and deliver the items when I'm not here. Hopefully an obliging neighbour will accept them. Really poor delivery service. Avoid Ikea online if you can."

  "articleText": "The delivery service in a IKEA Dublin is a disgrace. In IKEA Dublin shop, we have been told delivery is accommodating and the person we were speaking with put a note on our delivery for the hub/driver to deliver our products between 10am and 1pm on Monday 23 as it would have been hard to be home from 3pm to 5pm. The driver called us at 3:03pm saying that he could be to our place in 30 minutes. We told him it was too late now and the driver told us he could do the delivery tomorrow morning.  The day after, I took the day off from work to wait for the delivery and nothing. We then called the customer service to ask them when they were going to deliver. We first spoke to someone who contacted the Hub and told us it wasn't possible and, all of the sudden the phone hangs up! I We called again and continue the conversation with someone else. This time we learnt we were not scheduled for delivery and that we had to re-book, that the delivery was not going to happen today and neither tomorrow! We were not happy with this, but asked to be delivered on next Tuesday  because we are away, and we have been told there is a 4 days turn around for deliveries and that it can only be on Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays. We have been forced to ask a friend to get the delivery on Sunday for us and now our friend has to wait from 7am to 7pm to wait for the delivery. Even if drivers call an hour before the delivery, which is never true since they typically call 15mins to 30mins before they arrive, it is totally unacceptable to give no proper notice of delivery and force customers to stay home all day, while waiting for the call! There is a zero lack of flexibility and communication, they keep you waiting for as long as possible when trying to solve the issue by phone. So we got our friend to render herself available to Ikea delivery on a Sunday from 7am to 7pm,  and now we even have to move everything from our friends place to ours (useless to have it delivery on the first place). The customer service when calling is truly awful"

They don't deliver very often, so I picked April 16th as my delivery date.On April 12th, I received an email saying my delivery date was the 16th with a 12 hour window.I worked from home on the 16th, just so I could be here for the delivery.The entire day passed, no sign of Ikea.I called Ikea support to see where my delivery was.I was intially on hold for 15 mins.  The person who finally answered said the delivery date is only a suggested date.  The delivery could actually take anything from 2 to 4 weeks.I ask to cancel my order.  When I ordered, nothing was mentioned about this potentially taking a month to deliver a very basic computer table.  I was told it would be delivered today.She puts me on hold.  I am then on hold for 90 minutes.  That's not a typo.  They put you on hold for 90 minutes when you tell them you want to cancel an order.When the next person finally answers, I tell her I want to cancel.  She says she'll cancel it, but I won't get the delivery fee refunded, even though nothing has been delivered.I tell her that's unacceptable I want a full refund.  We go back and forth e a few times, she basically tells me \"too bad\", and then puts me on hold again.I've now been on hold for another 30 minutes when she gets back on the line and gives me a reference number.  They are not going to voluntarily refund the delivery fee.  I will have to see what the refund is then dispute the charge.In today's world, service like this is a disgrace.There are plenty of places to buy furniture from.  Find a reputable company and avoid this company at all costs.  Order a desk from Amazon and get it delivered in two days or go to a local store and support your local business.I will never again even consider buying from Ikea.Updated on May 22, 2018:I received word from my credit card company.  I had filed a dispute with my credit card about the charge and my credit card has given me a full refund, including the delivery fee that Ikea didn't want to refund.Ikea is the worst company I have dealt with in many years.

Really !!... a refund of an expensive service that they failed to deliver is a good will !!. He also promised and promised again it would be delivered on TuesdaySo Tuesday... nothing. So I call again and I speak with Alex, a supervisor who says my account is in 'Read only' and offers me £60, as Ikea offer a £30 per day compensation for a failed delivery. So shouldn't that be £90?. I asked to speak to a 'Team Leader', but will have to wait for them call me as per Ikea policy apparently.Now \"One of us is lying\", and maybe i've met my \"Waterloo\" with Ikea. let's see"

  "articleText": "WE live halfway up a mountain in South Wales and ordered a £700 mattress  they delivered a cheap bed base. Earlier that day our superking mattress had been picked up by our local authority so we had room to get the new mattress  in to our little cottage. Phoned Ikea six times but to no avail. So my wife and myself (both in our sixties) are now left without a bed to sleep on for another five days. There answer was we will refund you £35 so you can go and buy a temporary mattress. So we were expected to get a temporary superking mattress for £35! no problem! and yes it will go in the car no problem at all!! NOT so we are sleeping on the floor for the next five days. They have absolutely no concern for their customers and if it wasn't for the fact that my wife likes the mattress and the inconvenience of getting one from elsewhere at short notice approaching easter, I would be cancelling the order. DON'T USE THEM, their customer service is absolute rubbish."

Total compensation offered - £30. Even more insulting when my total spend this weekend (delivery order plus in store purchases) is over £3500. I’ve wasted a whole day waiting when I could have been more productive, had IKEA the integrity to tell me the initial problem in the first place.Dear Ikea - if we’re talking compensation I think you need to start by adding a “0” to the above figure. I don’t think 20% of the total purchase price of the order is unreasonable.Over to you!"

We spent £1,600 and as we live on the Isle of Wight requested delivery from the Southampton Store. After spending a couple of days assembling I discovered one door valued at £30 was missing. Query via their webiste was ignored. I phoned the store numerous times to be put on hold for ever and eventually got through, only to be told that I must be lying as all of the items were delivered and signed for!!  59 boxes arrived on delivery day with some very flustered delivery drivers, checking each individual item would have been  impossible. IKEA headquarters had recommended that a door be sent out immediately, but Southampton Store refused to send this as they said it had been sent and signed for. SOUTHAMPTON STORE MANAGER you should be ashamed of yourself...and the reputation that you have given IKEA.  Eventually after speaking to someone more senior in the head office, we will be sent the missing door.  After all why would I hide/steal a door worth £30 after spending £1,600!!! Perhaps staff should use a little more common sense and have a better understanding of Customer Service. IKEA you are a rich company why risk your reputation in this way, especially in this economic climate.  I personally will be shopping elsewhere to complete my house furnishing."

  "articleText": "Kitchen Installed Against RegulationsI planned my kitchen with Ikea, took the plans back to them multiple times to review to ensure something like this did not happen. It's not until we tried to get a new cooker (which was an amazing deal which we have now lost out on) a few months after the kitchen was installed we found out that the extractor hood above it was installed far too close to our existing oven be legally safe. The oven was on the plans. The extractor itself (and the entire kitchen) was installed by Ikea fitters and in the instructions for the extractor it specifies a minimum distance it needs to be from the cooker/hob, and was installed in our kitchen 11cm too short of this distance. Because this was installed into a cupboard (also installed by the fitter, also on the plans reviewed by Ikea), we now have to get a new cupboard at additional cost to ourselves, and fit it again.This is not something I expect to happen when I ask the kitchen department to review the plans and make sure the kitchen is safe & acceptable.This is not something I expect to happen when paying for an entire kitchen.This is not something I expect to happen when I pay again for professional fitting (which had several other additional problems in itself; fitters turning up late, leaving early, finishing the job a day late, shoddy workmanship which was have had to cover up)What I do expect is swift resolution from Ikea."

I mean we planned a working desk based on OUR kitchen project and we mistaked bi 30 cms!!!\" Trying to show some understanding to the clearly difficult situation in wich such comapny must find itself just said \" Well, you know, maybe it was also my mistake, I should have checked the work of your colleague....\" Answer: 'Absolutely not! it was our mistake and in 6 weeks we will fix it!\" Tired but happy, I went home7) After 2 weeks without any information I tried to call the mitical authomatic number, also here 8 calls and 12 emails8) After being replied another time to go to the shop (because in reality I leave there, on a mounted bed) finally somebody that must be considered, according to local standard, some kind of nobel prize answered:\"Sorry but  we cannot do anything, it is your measures, not ours\"With laughing tears I answered to the local evolutionary missing ring that 1) The measures were their measure because the project was their project 2) that we had already had the same conversation including a pilgrimage from my side  to Ikea shops and we had already agreed to change the working desk.Those two concepts together clearly need time to be elaborated so I am still waiting for an answer.....My suggestion: stay away from those guys, they simply have no idea what they are doing!!!!!"

IKEA's problem is that it sources manufacturing around the world and clearly quality control is poor.  The store is too far away to travel back and return items so you end up doing a fix yourself. I won't be buying from IKEA again."

Called ikea, they promised to investigate, still waiting. VITAL Parts of the bedframe were missing. Called the store. Arranged to pick them up. We’re given the wrong ones. Called back customer service where a guy called Ian refused to arrange delivery of those parts since they are of awkward shape. Couldn’t help find solution and refused to put through to his manager. Never again. Hope ikea burns in hell!"

Has anyone tried to get the flat pack items on the trolley, That is the easy bit then try to get your trolley around the self service area while pushing a wheelchair at the same time. The staff just watch. Have done this several times over the last year, and each time the staff are more than happy to watch while twiddling their thumbs. Only help I have recieved was for the odd customer who has seen me struggle and offered to take the trolley to the tills,while I push the wheelchair, but even this is rare.To add insult to injury after I have paid only then they may ask if I need help to my car.Ikea should start to help their customers more. If anyone else has had this problem, how to get a wheelchair and a loaded trolley around the area I would be interested to hear, as I do not think I am the only one who has this problem."

Why should I, I bought it from Ikea. After getting no responses from Ikea I contacted Electrolux who then instructed me to ring a repair agent. What customer service from either the seller or manufacturer!!. The Engineer visited end of December. Walked in looked at it and agreed the model had problems with spin sensors. Said he would send in a report. Visit time 5 minutes. Waited  and waited and waited so finally I rang Ikea mid January to be told they didn't have the report and would send out another Engineer. Rang Electrolux they insisted report to refund/ replace had been sent. Went higher up the ikea chain to find someone who admitted the report had been received. Finally an offer to pick up and refund. This goes on re the pickup, no notification of a time block as promised, but a 10 minute call from the driver received when I was not at home. From beginning of November to 26.01.18 we have a washer that doesn't spin. We have relied on an 20 year old zanussi upright spinner that was in our garage to finish the spinning. Ikea advise now they will pick up at 4pm today, I'm not holding my breath. This washer was £400, I have ordered one of better specification elsewhere for £300"

The customer service offered no help and simply told me that they didn't know what happened. They neither tried to help nor understood my time being wasted. All they do is to keep making new pick-up schedules for me and not able to tell me what time the pick-up trunk is coming. Excuse me! They thinkI just have all the time in the world in this holiday season sitting in my apartment for a whole day waiting for some trucks that would never ever show up, huh?  In conclusion, this gives me so many disappoints from this company. Yes, their furniture is cheap, but it does not mean they can treat their customers like the penniless."

Useless and incompetent employees work in customer services and they promise to call you back but they never do, probably because they p*ss themselves when they deal with angry and fed up customers.

Paid for the delivery. It didn’t come, I’ve heard 4 different excuses. One being their delivery drivers were given 2 days off because of snow. Considering they got parcel force to deliver and it wasn’t that bad in Peterbrough that excuse doesn’t cut with me. Their other excuse was that parcel force where 4/5 days behind in their deliveries and that parcel force would not deliver on a weekend. Very strange when we phoned up parcel force and got them to deliver part of the parcel on the Sunday and they hadn’t even phoned them at all.  They offered us £30 gift voucher for their store which considering my husband has took days off work to complete the kitchen, we’ve phoned up everywhere trying to chase our missing parts is a total insult and after the way we’ve been treat do they seriously think I’d ever want to shop in their store again!!! I explained to the company my children ranging from 18 to 27 had lost their dad in August and I had invited them to mine for Christmas dinner to try and make it as nice as possible under the circumstances yet they have told me they cant deliver it now until the 30th December. We even offered to drive 350 miles to get the unit ourselves and were told we wouldn’t be allowed through the security gate. We told them to bring it to the gate and we would wait outside they still wouldn’t allow us to go collect. We asked for managers to contact us and they don’t have any aparently, contacted them on Facebook and they answered a few messages and then stopped replying. Stay well clear from ever ordering anything on line from this company, in fact stay clear, their customer service is diabolical. So merry Christmas Ikea, thanks for nothing"

From the new kitchen that I had delivered just one drawer panel was faulty and had to be replaced.  Ikea couldn't order a proverbial **** up in a brewery - twice now I have been promised a date and received the usual text etc beforehand - stayed in and arranged my day so that I could sign for the goods - then been disappointed when twice they didn't turn up.  Builders booked both times so have incurred cost there too.Hopefully third time lucky for delivery a few days before Christmas but too late for it to be installed.  Keeping fingers crossed that they do in fact deliver when they say they will.  Otherwise I will have to find a way to remove that final star.Not happy  - I hope other customers take note - and especially whoever is in charge of customer services at this giant company.  Shame on you."

Queue for that too. Fair enough, the food is cheap but the products are not as cheap. Now i am wondering if they will ask their customers to also wash the plates after they are done? We shall see. In any case, i like their products but just be wary of what you buy and why."

Fittings were exact and tolerances of unit parts strengthened those parts.However, the Tjana file boxes were of a such an  extremely low quality cardboard, they looked like a joke. I demand a refund.The Drona cloth shelf boxes were attractive and functional while the Branas whicker baskets were so weak and ill fitting they are not fit for purpose. I demanded a refund.The Ballymun store experience is great while the website is so dated its ridiculous. Janis and Ciaran were especially good in the store as were the checkout staff. There is not even a purchasing page on the website.In other words, on one hand well done, on the other hand shame on Ikea.Martin Reid"

  "articleText": "This was by far the worst experience I have ever had! I ordered a bed frame that included a night stand head board. Half the delivery arrived on time and the other half missing. I contacted Ikea MANY times and waited on hold at the minimum 1 hour. They showed zero urgency to get the other half of my bed to me even though I was sleeping on the floor. I was offered a $50 gift to make up for it......because that changes the situation...... the order was canceled many times for no reason and I ended up waiting 3 months for the rest of my bed. I demanded a refund which they haggled with me as long as they could, again waiting on hold many times for over an hour. Finally gave up the fight with a 20% refund. The bed is great after I got the rest of it but customer service was awful and I would never wish that on anyone. AVOID ORDERING ONLINE!! Is there a zero star option?"

  "articleText": "Bought a corner sofa , when it arrived half of it was brown (suppose to be dark grey) and the brown half was 100% a reject or refunded as it was covered it layers of dirty old fluff and looked as if an animal was sleeping on it. Then complained and said they would send a brand new sofa ( one that was ONE sofa and ALL one colour as we ordered) waited 5 weeks again for them to get this NEW sofa delivered it was the long weekend so we had to cancel our weekend away as we thought the arrival of the sofa we had been waiting patiently on was more important, then no one showed. Which is not surprising as half of the comments on here explain the lack of decency that Ikea show to its loyal customers! Then went in and complained after cancelling our holiday for absolutely no reason!!!!!! Then they told us they had lied the whole time and the sofa was completely out of production meaning there was no 'new one' which was suppose to arrive . They said they will have to refund us the money for the sofa after wasting 2 and a half months altogether , kept waiting and waiting and no hope! I cannot express how utterly disgraceful Ikea is, for such a big company all they care about is money and could not give a feck about customer service. If there was a NO STARS rating on this that's exactly what they would be getting and what they deserve , absolutely shocking to say the least. PLEASE NO ONE EVER EVER EVER GO OR ORDER OFF IKEA I CANT EXPRESS IT ENOUGH, you will thank me"

I had delivered this week a Sofa bed which is not perfect but acceptable. meanwhile i wish to purchase a wardrobe so i have tried to use your extremely difficult, non intuitive and frankly rubbish piece of design software. It stinks! four times now i have tried to use it and it does not automatically save the item i am looking at, it is not intuitive so that when i try to set the deign height to 2010mm height i an just as likely to find I end up with 2036 height! Sh it! back out again and have another go. now thoroughly peed off and have given up. trouble is there is no store in Sardinia even though the Island is as large as England. No matter I thought i would try the UK setup but, although i am an Ikea \"family\" member your badly designed system tells me I am not registered. YES  I AM!!, if i try and sign in on the Italian site it transfers me to the Netherlands and tells me i am not registered on this site. I keep going round in circles. I actually have purchased a 10 room house in Cuglieri and after some building works intend to install three bathrooms, two kitchens, outfit four large bedrooms and a large living room and i was intending to use yourselves (Italy) branch but you and your company make it too difficult. Online? I don't think so, you're in the dark ages! By now you may have realised i am rather fed up, perhaps you could pass this on to your head office, Mike Rosep.s. i will post this on TrustPilot"

  "articleText": "We ordered a 65 pound bookcase from Ikea which was delivered on Sunday 15th October x2 panels were damaged with huge dents and scratched (careless delivery drivers who have no respect!!). We complained and it was arranged that the x2 panels would be collected and replaced today - Wednesday 18th October. My Husband had to take the day off work to wait in all day for the delivery men (My Husband is self employed so we lost a days wage) We have now discovered that one of the panel's for the bookcaseare is damaged..... AGAIN! Feeling extremely fed up and annoyed I phoned Ikea Croydon to ask for a full refund. We are told that the bookcase will need collecting, I explain my Husband has partially assembled it and taking it apart would cause damage. The woman then tells us we would not be entitled to a full refund!! They offered to replace the panels again but I refuse to waste anymore of our time and money on such cheap rubbish delivered by morons who are clumsy and careless. Ikea have completely wasted our time and caused a massive inconvenience to us not once.. but twice! We have lost significant money which has made a negative impact on us and it is all down to their incompetence and negligence. Ikea have taken no responsibility and are refusing to refund us for their misconduct. I will be escalating this issue and posting this information on social media to make all members of the public aware.Most definitely unacceptable and rude conduct. The woman from customer services was abrupt and extremely unhelpful! It has been an awful experience and law's with regards to consumer rights have been broken."

I stayed at home waiting the insane time span they make you stand-by (14-21) and NO ONE CAME!!! I was furious and called the next day. They said the delivery people hadn't followed \"protocol\" and that they would reschedule on the next tuesday the 10th. So again I waited from 14-21 and again no one showed up. No I was just so incredibly angry and I was told that my errand would be sent to another department that would call me back \"sometime\" they couldn't specify when and I of course could not contact them in anyway. Of course no one in this incompetent company called so I called once again (sitting fir like the 100th time in their insanely long phone line). This time I demanded to speak to someone above the idiots in customer service, who obviously don't have any authority to do anything. They said the guy was on a break and that they would call back in 10 min. NO. ONE. CALLED. I have no decided to demand a full refund and hopefully some store credit or something for missing 2 half days off work and living without furniture for 2 weeks. I am SO disappointed in this whole experience."

Phoned IKEA apparently Driver couldn't find address! IKEA has delivered to this address on numerous occasions so it sits on their sat nav system- just a lazy driver who couldn't be bothered on a Sunday to deliver. Heartbroken 4 years old no new bed etc., had arranged for her old cot bed to picked up this morning so no bed for 4 yrs old to sleep in tonight.  IKEA could only  deliver in 5 days time or maybe at a push tomorrow but IKEA couldn't definitely confirm that; I would have to wait a couple of hours for the next phone call.......    We WILL NOT ever purchase from IKEA again. Off to buy a bed from John Lewis their customer service can never be faulted.  They care about their customers."

I just wish they would deliver at home too as was a bit of an effort to get all back. Otherwise all went well, the bed and mattress were as expected and easy to assemble and next time just going to order all i need in one go instead of piecemeal. Will help if there was a store near me as going to Dublin each time is not the best option and at times to see the products in person is more helpful than just online."

  "articleText": "(In my own personal opinion or perception) the place is an absolute dump.*The staff non existent customer service I've never come across a set of rude, blasé' nonchalant assistants than this place. I used to have to go to Wembley which was the nearest store, when this place opened the staff were all nicey, nicey now they dont give two hoots. Their only concern is surrounding you at the tills to make sure you pay, with security that look like out of Camberwick green (I'm so scared). if I wanted to nick your goods I would go around the other way and just walk out of the entrance.*The food and the restaurants at 1720 hrs today the place looked like an earthquake, food everywhere staff milling around doing absolutely as little as possible. The Logan berry juice dispenser empty again ! I noticed the staff putting massive portions of fish on plates laughing and joking, then taking them out of the back kitchen doors. The food they served the customers slopped on the plate like food in the military out on exercise, (kids meal = 6 runner beans, 10 chips and a piece of fish that looked like 2 fish fingers stuck together £2). Absolute joke ! Dirt. muck and filth all over the restaurant seating area and 1 lady cleaning a central curved carousel table, over and over again. \"Obviously waiting for the night time cleaners to do most of the lackeying\" ?* Management where are they ? I never see them and they certainly aren't about kicking backsides into work ? it's no wonder the place is so badly run. If this is the way they do things in Sweden which I know for a fact it surely cant be, then things have changed in the land of Volvo and Saab.*The products aren't worth the money any longer, there's too much competition out there now like B&M stores, Wilko, and pound shops. You could be buying a dream with fools gold, that could end up being a nightmare ?"

Ikea changed my delivery date twice to suit them as they did not have the goods which I had ordered and paid for in stock, The second change was made, at 7.30 in the evening the day before the delivery was due.  When I phoned to say the day they wanted to delivery didn't suit I ended up talking to a rude young man who to say the least was unhelpful. I needed to know what time the new delivery would be and all he would tell me was between 7am and 7 pm  I asked for a supervisor to call me, he assured me this would happen yet an hour later, no call,  When I phoned again, he had hidden by order on the system, making it virtually impossible for the person I was speaking with to find my details,.  When she eventually did, he had not changed the delivery day as requested, meaning that 37 packages would have been delivered to an empty house. Nor had he logged my requested for a call back I have tried to speak to someone in a senior position to make a complaint to but Ikea won't give any contact details.  I have emailed them and no response.  Their products are okay but unless you have no other option, I would avoid their delivery service."

  "articleTitle": "IKEA doesn't care if young children fall from the stairs or get electrified",
  "articleText": "A while ago we ordered two Patrull stair gates and a small Patrull night lamp at IKEA. We ordered them on the website and got them delivered, since the IKEA store is very hard to reach for us.We don't own a car and don't have driver licenses (purposely). To get to the IKEA store we have to walk to the railway station, to take the train, transfer to an other train, transfer to a minibus service and finally walk about 15 minutes in an industrial area. On my own it's already quite a journey. To get there with our small children (0 and just 3 years old) is nearly impossible. And when we would ever get there, we have to get back home too...One of the advantages of getting the IKEA order delivered, is that you don't have to get back to the store, when something gets broken, but a repair service comes to your house.Now appears that the stair gates and night lamp are disfunctional. They are unsafe:- The stair gates can suddenly open, so children can fall from the stairs. Epic fail from IKEA!- The cap of the night lamp can come off, so children can get electrified. Again: epic fail from IKEA!IKEA called both products back, so costumers can get there money back. Apparently IKEA doesn't want to be the company that let toddlers fall from the stairs and put 220 volts through their little bodies after all.However...We have to take the unsafe stair gates and night lamp to the IKEA store to get our money back. I tried to explain several times that this would be impossible for us, but IKEA just replies with their standard answers.\"Sorry sir. We didn't provide for this. We're not going to provide anything for this. You can also take in the products later. Even a year later.\"In a year we still don't have a car, so we still got stuck with the unsafe stair gates and night lamp.Because IKEA behaved this irresponsible by bying or developing cheap 'child safe' products, we have a loss of about 100 euro. (Two stair gates, a night lamp and the delivery costs. When we order new, safe stair gates, we have to pay delivery costs again, so this is also a real loss.)I offered IKEA to send them a picture or video, with me destroying the products, so they can give our money back. They said that wasn't there policy.Without blinking there eyes IKEA takes 100 euro from a family with two young children for potentially lethal products, but they're not behaving responsible when they get caught selling this very dangerous rubbish.So, is this the earning model of IKEA? Take your money and let your children die? Not cool! Not cool at all!---Update: of course, after banging the internet drums, IKEA did pick up the dangerous items and will hopefully give the money back."

  "articleText": "I've been a fan of IKEA for years for basics like shelving, drawer inserts, dishware, rugs, etc. I previously had an IKEA bed, but it was too basic for my taste and I now have a more decadent bed. But if you like a more simple or classic aesthetic, their beds are pretty good. I still have a mattress from them that I love! I was skeptical about getting an IKEA mattress at first, but my  mom's friend had one and loved it, so I decided to test theirs in store. I found the prices to be amazing compared to other mattress retailers, and liked the firmness of the foam. Unrolling it was kinda fun too, because it poofs up and expands before your eyes!Building the furniture used to be a pain, but I've actually gotten pretty fast at it now that I have an electric screwdriver (IKEA too). Plus, I have moved enough times that I can remember the building directions by heart. I find I have a small sense of pride after building the shelves or whatever. But I know for others that's an annoyance, so if you plan to get IKEA staff to build for you, make sure you evaluate the total cost when comparing other stores. For some items you may not be saving much, and their wood is closer to particle board quality, so you may be better off getting a sturdier piece for a bit more. I personally find the quality to be good enough for my shelves and whatnot, and didn't have a problem when I used to have an IKEA sofa and chair set. However, the bed I used to have did have slats that broke in several places, and the wood on the table I have scratches pretty easily."

We contacted ikea who passed it on to the delivery company who basically put the phone down on us and will not get back in contact despite leaving messages. This is down to ikea as I've passed it back to them and still getting no response. Disgusting behaviour from a leading company and we have a damaged banister... The person who delivered it was in his 50s as we have him on cctv so not a young lad that doesn't no better.....no respect...."

The quality of the cabinets was clearly better than expected. F.e. the surface coating is much better, thicker and more robust  than with other producers in the same price category.But the best was really the aftersales service: regardless what issue I had, it was immediately corrected, swift and with no questions. In one case a package had been damaged, in another case something missing. A phone call was enough and a few days later we got the spare parts, even in one case 2 years after."

Got it delivered the next day (an additional $70 fee)...then spent 3 hours in the delivery line to top it all off.Got it delivered, at 11am next day Opened the box and found a few screws missing.Went back up there and it  2 hours for the customer service rep to give us a new bag of screws.Got home opened the bag and they were THE WRONG SCREWS!!! I spent about 45 minutes comparing the screw to see if there was an error, NO WRONG BAG, WRONG SCREWS.By now it's about 3:30 pm, our whole afternoon is almost over.Feeling very irritated we went back up there again!!!THIS IS WHERE THEY CROSSED THE LINE!! After a brief conversation the customer service rep brought out ADRIEN in Recovery Clearance.This guy was so rude to me, my mother and girlfriend, accusing us of not knowing what we were talking about and out right telling us we were lying.We told ADRIEN several time that the screws we were given the Second time at IKEA was the wrong size but ADRIEN refused to listen. He continued his aggressive rant leaning over, over-talking my mother and girlfriend and telling them they were all wrong!!Kind of upset I kept my composure to explain to ADRIEN that I personally spent 45 minutes assembling the furniture and he must have made a mistake. Even still his aggressive demeanor and assertive over-talking watered out my obvious complaint.Still we waited and after another 2 hours we finally got the 2 SCREWS we were waiting for.The customer service rep and ADRIEN grouped together to inspect the screws, with ADRIEN bellowing under his breath. ( there were 2 different sized screws by the way)Upon leaving I asked the customer service rep to speak to ADRIEN I felt my mother and girlfriend deserved an apology for how he talked to them.I wanted to see if he was a man of integrity, could admit his wrongs and forgive my family for the disrespect.He claimed he couldn't come out for whatever reason after spending the last 30 minutes arguing with us.If he would have came out and apologized I would not have left this review but...ADRIEN IN RECOVERY CLEARANCE IS A RUDE, INDECENT, UNPOLAGENTIC EMPLOYEE WITH NO CUSTOMER SERVICE CAPABILITY AND RUNIED OUR 8 HOUR LONG DAY AT IKEA!!Way to go ADRIEN!!!"

Everything was delivered on the correct day too.I had to call customer services and was waiting for 18 mins to get through. Not great but when I did get through, the man I spoke to was straight to the point (although lacking the pleasantries and chit chat some other  companies engage in..which wasn't a bad thing).He ordered a replacement part because a part of the wardrobe snapped whilst I was building it.Based on this experience,  I would order again."

  "articleText": "My pregnant wife and I were in IKEA yesterday, 31-03-2015. There, we were told that we couldn't get some of our products right away, even though they were on stock, because they were at the top of the warehouse and had to be picked up after closing hours.We were instead offered to pay for our order and have it delivered to us the next day, for 600DKK extra (200 for \"plucking,\" 400 for delivery). We paid the order in full and were promised it would be delivered between 15 and 19 today, 01-04-2015.We have waited the whole day without anyone arriving or calling. At 19:30, past the delivery deadline, I have contacted IKEA chat. There, I was told my order was unfortunately somehow \"lost\" in the system and erased. Instead, I was told that I should expect my order on Saturday. I said I found that unacceptable, since i have waited for the order and was not going to be available on Saturday. Then I got a call from the transport company, saying they would arrive today after all.They have arrived at 20:30. The order they delivered was 90% wrong. Most of the items on my list were missing, and many items I didn't order were included. They took the order back, and I insisted they give me a contact number for someone who could solve my issue. Upon calling that number, I was told I should instead call IKEA kundeservice, which is not closed. They will be closed for the following 2 days. This means that my wife and I won't get the chance to use our two days off to prepare the baby's nursery, like we planned.In conclusion: Delayed delivery, ZERO communication until I myself took the initiative, wrong order. Order at your own risk.EDIT 05-04-2015: Yesterday (Saturday), I still haven't received any contact from IKEA. I called them instead. We agreed that they would deliver after 19:00. I re-asked twice whether I can be assured that my full order will be delivered. They twice guaranteed that it will.Since then, and up until now (Sunday morning), I have not heard a word from them, via phone or email, and nobody has delivered my order, even though I have waited at home since 19:00.I wish it were possible to give companies negative star ratings."

  "articleText": "I bought 6 pieces in Bangkok in beginning of august 2014, as well as several other items. It is the chairs it is about. The two loose legs on the chair was packed wrong. The paint was not properly dry before being packed and they were just packed closely together without paper between. The result is to destroy some of the paint.One of the chairs was completely deformed, so we had to spend a few hours driving back to Ikea over in Bang Na. The problem with the wrong package, they knew well ...!? [COARSE LANGUAGE REMOVED] ? The chairs were assembled, so that was my problem now.After they found a chief who had the necessary permission to undertake a replacement of the chair (half hour), we could then drive home again.I have asked Ikea the following questions: Was it a good idea to equip the factory in China with quality control? Should they have a quality, then they should perhaps consider using a different one, and not from blind Foundation.Ikea didnt answer my letter.When you have a product that has a known bug with the paint, so I think you should consider to solve it, and not like now, where I have to figure out how to repair the two chairs that are damaged.See the pics here: [EXTERNAL REFERENCE REMOVED]In the restaurant we got 2 bonus tickets, each at 100 Thb which could be used for the purchase of furniture. By paying it appeared that I could max use one at a time. We should of course shared the order in two. At that time I only wanted to leave the store, and if I had been here without his wife, so I had gone without my goods long time ago, in fact since I came to the store where I have to figure out what parts I need, where to find it, and how to handle 2 heavy shells. A woman didnt want to give us any kind of help.I chose to go back and give it to another customer, Ikea should under no circumstance be spared the 100 Thb.PS ....

I hesitated to order at first as i thought the delivery was expensive (£35). But had no choice as i am about to have baby and cant risk driving far also lifting and to be honest it wouldn't fit in my car. So after a week of ordering and paying for the goods the delivery day arrived but only half of my delivery was there couldn't fault that men that delivered them friendly nice and offered to take it up to babys room for me. I asked about the other half of my order and they said it was damaged ikea didn't pack which is fair enough they then said they should have contacted you which they never for all i knew i was half the set down. So i then got on the phone to them after waiting 40 mins in a que to get threw to someone i gave up and left it till the following day after waiting again on hold for a further 50 minuets i eventually got threw to a nice enough lad called lee explained the situation he apologised ect not that it was his fault explained i was having baby in 3 weeks and wanted it all set up can i just collect it saves waiting around for more weeks he said hell check and call me back no call back no nothing that then made my experience with ikea online even more shocking don't sympathise if you don't care i was more then understanding as i know these things happen, maybe if i was a irate customer i would have got delt with there and then i would have preferred to be called all the names under the sun then fobbed off! However the day after i got a call from some rude lady saying shes sorry shell get another one sent out asked about a date or a ruff chase date nothing couldn't tell me just that its going to come so more then likely after my baby is born so the nursery is not set up!! so after chasing them wasting my time paying 35 pound for delivery  and paying for cost of calls i have received the worst customer service! Not good enough for such a big international company."

So we placed a order and within a week our delivery arrived.....1ST CALL. Waited for 45 minutes for a response.Having received our delivery for a bed from Ikea we noticed there was no bed slats included on the order notes or in the delivery. After phoning Ikea we spoke to Sarah, who informed us that the reason for this is because we didn't include them in order. This was not the case as it was included in the price of the bed and it was a fault with their order management software. Delivery is to be rearranged on Saturday.Waited on Saturday until 1 pm after no indication of delivery confirmation of the dispatch of ETA of arrival.2nd call. Waited 45 mins for a response.Spoke to a unknown Rep, who had no information about our case as the previous rep had not included enough detail in their CRM/Case management software (poor show Ikea). Rep said he needed to make another call and would keep me on hold for a few mins. After waiting 45 minutes the automated system dropped the call....3rd call. 45 minutes on hold.Spoke to Richard, who was useful however he informed me that he was due to finish his shift in 30 minutes and would forward our case into a responsible person who he confirmed would take ownership of our issue and call us back with a follow up on the status of our order.3rd call - 5pm Saturday 45 mins waiting for a response.Spoke to Shane, who very honestly admitted it doesn't look like its coming today. Which resulted in our house guests sleeping on the floor.......Shane processed our order for some new bed slats and rearranges a 3rd delivery slot for us. despise us informing him that we cannot simply book a day off work at the drop of the hat to receive these orders he books us in a slot for this Monday 9-4 pm. No use to us what so ever... Shane then put a request in for a £30 voucher for our troubles not enough in my opinion.4th call Waited 45 minutes for a response.We then rearranged delivery for today 23/7/14....WHAT A SURPRISE....Delivery does not arrive.....How can a company as large as IKEA treat their customers like this?!?!I would not recommend ever purchasing a product from Ikea home delivery service. As our experience has been a absolute nightmare."

The 3rd time it was my GF, and since I was sleeping like a babe and never even woke up to notice her cursing and moving to the sofa, I can't really complain about that one ;)Anyway. Turns out the slatted bed base wasn't broken, but simply shifted between the sides and fell down through the opening. Since the bed had been incresingly squeekish ever since I moved from my old apartment I decided to check the screws to see if they were still alright... Imagine my suprise when I found that half of the screws were not there! Suddenly I felt very lucky that I hadn't completely ruined the bed in the last months (moral of the story... If your little brother says \"Go take care of the dishwasher...I'll set up the bed by myself, no problem!\" Make sure he doesn't discard half the screws and uses tie-wraps instead because he finds it quicker...)After checking my supplies I found a breadbag with most of the screws and several other missing parts I never even knew existed, but in the end I still came up short on a few of those long typical IKEA screws... Since the bed was over 10 years old and was no longer sold by Ikea, I feared I was screwed (yes... pun intended. Shame on me) But I decided to contact them anyway to see if I could buy them somehow. I was very glad that all they needed was the amount of screws I needed and the screw id-number, - I found this in a manual online- and they would send it to me free of charge.Five days later I received the screws in a giftbag with a complete Customs Declaration. Origin; Sweden. With them I was able to fix my bed, and what do you know... It hasn't squeeked once since. Nice service!"

As many people probably know IKEA has recently decided to annoy the customers by discontinuing some lines in the middle of the life of their catalogue, so I had difficulty of buying some doors for my cabinet frames. Mick not only arranged the order for me from start to finish but gave me a discount.How is that for service? Wait,that's not all.He arranged for some fabric samples to be sent to me as my local store does not sell them (why?) and so saved me a long track all across London for a few swatches. If everybody were like him at IKEA..."

Not a massive problem but I'd like to have a door for my wardrobe.Called after sales and spoke to a lovely girl who was sorting everything out for me, or so I thought. She said I would receive a replacement part within 3-5 working days. Great.After 4 days, I heard nothing despite being told I would get a text. So I called and spoke to a nice guy who advised that the part was with DPD and that he would get some tracking details for me. This never happened.My mum has called today to then be told that the part hasn't even been dispatched yet! After being told this I was livid so decided to call up myself. This time, the person who answered the phone sounded like he couldn't care less. I got a 'what ever' after almost everything I said. He then said he would get me the tracking details, the same as the two previous people.Looks like I'll just have to wait and hope that there is at least one competent person at the company who can fulfil my request and not constantly lie to me!Most definitely will not be ordering again."

Just order the bed frame and other stuffs to be delivered two days ago, realized that the bed frame doesn't included the instruction/installation menu. I called csutomer service but alway keep me on hold and rather impossible to reach them at all. In one of the call, I have been waiting for more than 45 minutes on the phone listening to those music they play on the phone. I believe non of any company let you hold till that long. Seems I have to work from Monday to Friday, with no other choices, my partner over 60th have to help me to go the Ikea Croydon by train and ask for the instruction. Again, the next day after compare and instruction menu so many tools was missing from the packaging and some of the woods look used with some old screw inside.  Again, couldn't reach them by phone, I have no choice but have to take a day off and go the Ikea again just because of the missing part and discrepancies of the products. Never never purchase from them anymore if you wish to have good after sales service. Small items should be fine as you can easily see them from the packaging but not the big stuffs."

  "articleTitle": "Disgraceful Delivery Service",
  "articleText": "Sorry for the long review, but I'm quite annoyed and feel the full story is the best way to illustrate Ikea's incompetence.Firstly I'd like to say the customer service staff are very friendly and helpful - I had no problem with them. The only issue there is the long call wait times, generally 10-15min minimum.The major problems came in with the delivery service. From the start, this was an absolute shambles. They initially gave me a provisional delivery date two weeks in the future, which was an annoyance but not unacceptable. A week later, however, I received a text message saying that they'd pushed back the delivery a week further, without any explanation for the significant delay. I decided to suck it up and just wait.In terms of delivery restrictions, I live in a town centre directly on a bus lane, so I informed Ikea that they wouldn't be able to park on the road and that they would need to pull up onto a drive next to the building. They sent a full-size lorry into the town centre, which wouldn't fit onto any drive I've ever seen, and barely fit up the road itself. Obviously, the delivery didn't go ahead, as the lorry drove on. I then had to wait an hour before I got a phone call from them to explain that they would have to redeliver another time on a smaller van, and that I would get a phonecall confirming this.This phonecall took 4 days to appear, at which point they confirmed a new delivery date (now 4 weeks from the original order date). Deciding to make absolutely sure this delivery would go through, I rang in again to confirm the delivery restrictions. The delivery service hadn't put that a smaller van was needed on the system, so I explicitly stated this to the call handler and it was put onto the system, otherwise I would have had a lorry come again.Roll on yesterday's delivery. I was given a delivery window by text of 6am-9am, which was a pain, but I was desperate to get the items delivered at all cost, so I left my phone on all night and waited for them to call. When I'd heard nothing by 9:30 the next day, I phoned customer services who were incredulous that I'd been given this delivery window as they can't deliver before 7am. On the system I was down for delivery between 1pm-5pm, and I'd get a call an hour in advance of delivery.Fine, I thought; I can go out and do other things as long as I'm back by 1pm. Wrong. I received a call at midday saying 'we'll be there in 5 minutes'. Being half an hour away, this wasn't ideal. Luckily I managed to convince them to wait for me to get there. When I was half-way there, though, I got another call. 'I don't think we're going to be able to deliver today as the van's too big and there's nowhere to park nearby.' Being already half-way back, I wasn't accepting this and convinced the driver to wait nearby. When I got there, I could see that the van would fit into the drive next to the building and told him to circle back round and park on the drive.Unfortunately, the ordeal didn't end there. As they unloaded the packages i could see they were numbered out of 9, but only 5 came out. Fully 4 of the 9 packages were missing. The drivers phoned up the warehouse and told me I'd get a phonecall once the warehouse staff had looked for these. I received no call yesterday, and now to today.I decided to phone up today to chase this, and according to customer services there was nothing on the system - the drivers had listed the order as complete. Possibly as revenge for getting them to do their job and deliver my items, possibly just further incompetence from Ikea. Luckily the call handler was helpful, and set up a search for the items and gave me a case number, but it's going to be at least 48 hours before I hear anything.So that's where I am now - one month after ordering, one fully failed delivery, one partially failed delivery (that would have fully failed without a lot of persuasion) and no idea when this will be resolved. I'm not looking forward to the next delivery, and I would recommend anyone considering purchasing items from Ikea to rent a van and pick it up themselves!"

On my way home from work I had a missed call received 2 hours earlier, 'We're outside your house, with your delivery.'I was livid.

  "articleText": "This has got to be the worst service I have ever received!Started by looking for items online and whilst considering the purchase a determining factor was delivery time. Online estimate was for the 8th of November which was fine. After I bought the product I was told the delivery wouldn't be until the 15th of November, which almost doubled the time I had to wait! I found that not only annoying but also slightly dishonest.I waited in on the 15th all day and effectively lost a day's worth of work, but thats ok if the items then get delivered. But, they didn't. When the delivery slot had 'expired' I attempted to call Ikea but the phone-line was engaged - I waited in excess of 35 mins in a queue and gave up!My Wife attempted to call again later - still in a queue for the best part of an hour, just to be told that the driver attempted to deliver my goods but there was nobody in! Now that I find insulting - he has obviously not been at the right address or he is lying. She asked for an immediate re-delivery but that could not be facilitated and I would have to take another day off work the following week. She asked for a refund of the delivery cost, which also couldn't be accomedated until delivery had taken place and the driver had been interviewed. So, she cancelled the order.I have still lost a day off work and have to find alternative place to purchase furniture. Its is poor service!Jesper Nors"

  "articleTitle": "Absolutely awful",
  "articleText": "This is the shortened version with some of the shortfalls left out to slim this down!We bought a bed frame and mattress in August this year, as one of the things that reassured us was the 90 day pledge to exchange the mattress if we didn't like it.  We were promised delivery the next day, but on the day of delivery we had to call them after 5pm as nothing had arrived. We were told that nothing at all had been scheduled and, bearing in mind our old bed was by then, at the rubbish tip non delivery was not an option and I made this clear to them and this was eventually sorted out but it wasn't a great start.The real problems came when we decided that we needed to exchange the mattress as it just wasn't comfortable.  The one we had tried was extremely comfy, but the one we endured for around a month was rock hard.  The staff in the store, although polite, didn't seen to understand the 90 day exchange or know what to do.  We spoke to three different people in the store and went away on the understanding that we would receive a phone call to schedule delivery of the new mattress, the old one would be picked up and as the new mattress was slightly cheaper, a refund would be processed.The new mattress has arrived and the old one wasn't picked up and I have no refund.  Every time I try to call there's a 30 - 45 minute wait to speak to someone, and all they can do is pass information on.  The store won't get back to me and I have sent numerous emails to complain.I have never experienced such a terrible system where you can't call or email the store directly, and the call centre can't help.  The whole thing has been a joke from start to finish and I will never use them for anything again."

I had a cupboard door, which was of a natural wood colour and whilst not faulty, had too much red in the it, making it look odd to the other 3 doors.  Ikea swapped this without issue.  The quality of their furniture is also good, 6 years on, everything is still as good as the day it arrived.  I like building my own furniture, as I customise the items to fit against my high skirting boards, so they fit flush to the wall.  Very pleased."

Packaging was filthy, so had to open everything outside. Legs of chair were missing, cover of chair was ripped open and dirty. Rang customer services, they refused to courier the items out to me, and said I would have to wait 6 days for standard truck delivery of the items (these are small items,  which would probably cost a tenner to send on a next day delivery. Ridiculous). I asked for some kind of refund of the delivery as I had taken a day off work to wait in for the items, we also have family coming to stay and this furniture was for their use. We will now have to quickly go out and buy the furniture elsewhere. Customer services refused any kind of refund of the delivery, and when I asked to speak to a manager they said 'they won't think any differently so there's no point'. The Ikea items will have to be returned, which will cost about £20 in petrol for a 2 hour round trip, plus the original £35 delivery charge, so I will have paid £55 for the pleasure of some dirty packaging and an unpaid day off work. Thanks Ikea, you really are as rubbish as everyone says."

I am disabled and although I used to love to shop at Ikea, I am so sad that I cannot anymore because they do not have motorized shopping carts for disabled people. They have a bunch of manual wheelchairs that I cannot use, and that are always sitting there unused by anyone. Also, whenever I have asked an employee to assist me ... I cannot believe their rude responses. They just want me to go away and leave them alone to do their jobs, which obviously is not helping customers, and especially not disabled customers who are so darn needy. Ikea is non-disabled friendly in so many ways. Shame on them. I was going to try the one in Bolingbrook,  but I see in someone else's review that they also do not have motorized shopping carts for disabled patrons. I asked an employee why they had no motorized carts for disabled shoppers and she said because the aisles are too narrow! LOL. Maybe they should use some of their own organization products."

My order number is 382960546 (bed, drawer, etc 6 items), order date online was 30/6/12.  The original delivery date was 6/7/12.  I had to take annual leave from work to receive the order.  The truck arrived but the driver came without the right equipment to deliver the items.  The driver was rude and mentioned that insufficient feedback when I have clearly instructed him to load at the loading bay.  He was not interested and simply wanted to pass the job back to someone else.  This is frustrating enough as I have wasted a day of my annual leave.  The driver made another delivery date 9/7/12 and I have asked for previous delivery time of 11 am.  However I have not received any confirmation and when I tried to check on ikea online delivery the system reports that no such order exists.  I am now in a situation of either taking another day of annual leave tomorrow risking no show from the delivery.  This is not a good experience at all!"

A lot of people slag off flat pack kitchens, but I put it up correctly and employed a private chippy to put a worktop on and do the finishing touchers and it looks better than others in very expensive shops and show rooms. total cost for our large kitchen was less than £3K, fitted and finished (dont use ikea fitters as they are expensive - did most of it myself as its not brain surgery - and employ a good chippy to do the finishing touchers - save loads of money that way).Ikea fitters wanted £3K to fit a £2K kitchen, thats just wrong.Other kitchens by other companies of simular look (but in my opinion not as good quality were about £10KI purchased the kitchen including appliances and paid a chippy and had change out of £3k"

I have ordered some large items for delivery recently and had no problems whatsoever with it.For extra discounts on selected goods, it's probably worthwhile getting an Ikea family card. This also gives you the opportunity to view future months discounted products.So a thumbs up from me."

  "articleTitle": "IKEA Kitchen  - very mixed results",
  "articleText": "My new IKEA kitchen is remarkable quality for the cost, but the good news stops there. Their estimator/designer made several mistakes with components that resulted in lots of unnecessary phone calls and visits to the store (a round trip of 140 miles each time). Plus they \"forgot\" to put our fridge freezer on the first delivery, sent the wrong plinths and shelves etc. But, absolutely the worst part of it was trying to get through to customer services on the phone. After waiting a long time in the queue, I was frequently just transferred back to switchboard to start all over again. On reflection, the quality and value for money just isn't worth the stress and inconvenience for such a major project. IKEA is fine for wee bits and pieces, but don't trust them with a major investment is my advice."

  "articleTitle": "At no point during the order process did ikea.co.uk live up to what we expect from an online retailer",
  "articleText": "The age of online shopping - it should be simple & easy. Ikea - it must be preferable to being herded around one of their cattle shed retail outlets, it has to be... I' rather spend a week lost in an Ikea store than go through the experience I've had with their astoundingly poor half-arsed online division.Ordered two products. Rather surprised to hear it'd be 2-3 weeks before they would arrive - that's not what I'd expect from online purchasing but hey-ho, the order is placed, no going back now.So 2.5 weeks pass, a driver calls to say he will be here within the hour, just as Ikea's text message said he would.The items have been packed at the very front of the wagon. The wagon has two holes in the roof. The items are wet through and damaged. The items go back...After several calls to Ikea, they finally 'phone back regarding the replacements: \"We will call you this afternoon to arrange re-delivery\". Eh? A call to say they will call? What's the point of that?No call.I called them back the next day, I'm told it'll be another 2-3 weeks before the replacements arrive.2 and a bit weeks later we receive a call from the driver's mate - will be here in around an hour. Some minutes later, another call - \"I just noticed your items are packed at the front of the wagon - there is a hole in the roof, your items are both wet through\"...deja vu?!Ikea wagon arrives, we tell the drivers they must have sent out the same items or used the same wagon again - they are strapped in at the far end of the wagon, the wagon has the same holes in the roof on either corner with all kinds of nasty green gunk where water has obviously been seeping through for many weeks or months.The driver tells us that this is a common problem - their wagons are regularly damaged by trees, especially in Wales (?! Welsh trees must be tougher than our puny English ones, I dunno...)So it seems to me, not only do Ikea have a very loose idea of what customers expect form an online shopping experience, they also have a fleet of (I'm told) 300 wagons, of which many have exactly the same defects as the two that attempted to deliver soggy chipboard shelving to our house.So as it stands I'd rather risk buying some poorer quality Argos shelving than have anything to do with the Ikea brand ever again, I'd take Engrish flat-pack over Swedish soggy any day of the week."

  "articleTitle": "Ikea Croydon - avoid",
  "articleText": "Like others I've used Ikea in the past and been happy enough with the experience.  However our local Croydon branch has now descended into a fleapit of dispair.Walking through the unhelpfully signposted 3 miles of showrooms, most in a shabby state, we found the thing we were looking for and moved on to the warehouse to pick up the flat-pack box.Having come prepared by checking online first that they had plenty of the item in stock, all we supposedly had to do was find which aisle it was located.There were 4 touch screens at a help point to enable you to find things, but 3 of the 4 were broken (zero points for maintenance), and the 4th one only partly worked, and naturally suffered from crowds/queues.  Once I got to the screen it indicated that iritatingly the item wasn't on the public shelves, so had to ask customer services.  Randomly manned information desks reinforced this obvious lack of service, and was told to go somewhere else to ask for it to be retrieved from out back.Landed in another long queue which initially wasn't manned at all, and only a passing staff member noticed that 10 people were angrily waiting.  Staff scribbled numbers down on torn scraps of paper for more un-motivated staff to stroll slowly off and browse whilst the queue just got longer and longer.About half an hour later I was then told that they did not have the item in stock and that they knew it shouldn't have been shown as in stock on their webpage....  This negligence and hopeless stock control underlines what a pointless waste of space this company has now become.Key points1.  About as disorganised and mis-managed as a 50 pence bizzare, which ironcially it now so closely resembles.2.  Poorly maintained showroom, a shabby shadow of it's previous self 4-5 years ago3.  Poorly signposted and therefore painfully drags out the dire experience even longer4.  Unprofessional - you couldn't have paid to train an organisation to run so dis-functionally5.  Nasty, messy and tacky are all things which Ikea Croydon can only aspire to achieve, and has some way to go to reach these dizzying heights"
